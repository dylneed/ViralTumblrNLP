# Can you predict if a post/meme/idea will go viral on Tumblr?

<!-- ### Abstract -->

### 1. Introduction

For this project, I will look at a large number of text-only posts and tags that have gone ‘viral’ on Tumblr.
This data is not easily available, so I will need to pull the data myself, 
but Tumblr does have an API for getting posts, so I will be using that to grab the corpus.
I plan on mainly looking at the number of ‘notes’ a post has to determine how viral it went. 
The number of ‘notes’ a post have is equivalent to the number of likes, ‘reblogs’, and replies the post received, 
and I think that is a very useful tool for evaluating engagement on a large scale. 
The biggest hurdle of this project is going to be getting the data, 
and performing tasks on it, as the dataset will end up being very large.
