So unsurprisingly, the media/news/practically everyone has NOT been talking about this rape case. \u00a0Like really at all. \u00a0And uh, personally, I feel like the frontrunner for PRESIDENT OF OUR COUNTRY really SHOULD be scrutinized publicly as much as god damn possible for this. \u00a0How can an allegation that he RAPED A CHILD be pushed to the side and deemed irrelevant? \u00a0I mean, HONESTLY.\u00a0\nBut so my question here is not WHY this happening, but I am super curious about what could happen later.\nSay Trump wins the election and becomes president, then the case continues, more evidence keeps coming out of the woodwork, maybe the news even starts talking about it (Because they would right? Because now Trump has already achieved office. \u00a0Now this is just some hot dramatic story that can\u2019t contribute to him losing.), a trial eventually does happen.\nWhat is generally supposed to happen when our president is involved in a lengthy criminal trial? \u00a0Because with the average person, their whole life gets put on hold while they deal with it. \u00a0Is the PRESIDENT going to have to put his life on hold? \u00a0Who would be running the country then?\nWhat happens if he\u2019s found guilty? Then do we just wind up with a convicted pedophile rapist as our president now? Is it impossible to undo since he already won the election?\nHow does impeachment of the president even work? Can him being found guilty of this crime be enough in itself for him to be impeached? \u00a0Does being a convicted criminal automatically disqualify you from being the president? \u00a0Do the American people get a say in an impeachment? \u00a0Like, is it voted on? \u00a0If so, by who? \u00a0\nLastly, it would interest me to hear anyone\u2019s personal opinions on this as well. \u00a0No, not your blubbering on how much you trust Trump is innocent; i mean on the overall possibility that we could have a president be proven guilty for such a scary crime AFTER he\u2019s already assumed office.\nThanks for taking time to read this and maybe even answer me, yall.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "nightwingisasuperfan", "id": 148369090513, "date": "2016-08-02 22:43:30 GMT", "timestamp": 1470177810, "tags": ["dc", "marvel", "discourse", "suicide squad", "bvs"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z6Recq2ABVAVH", "note_count": 14, "body": "Look\nI will admit it simply to get it out of the way:\nI used to be one of those Marvel fans that absolutely shit on DC at every chance I got\nThanks to my friends, my eyes have been opened to DC and I now see the merits of both.\nThe problem is, though, that however much I want to like both, it seems impossible with all of this discourse. Marvel has made some shitty decisions recently that I am unable to overlook while DC has blessed its fans with trailers for Justice League and Wonder Woman.\nThe thing that is bugging me the most right now, though, is the constant need for people to compare the two because, inevitably, Marvel always comes out on \"top\". I've seen this with BvS and I'm seeing it again with SS and I'm sick of it. DC and Marvel are comic companies and that is where the similarities end. They tell very different stories in very different ways and it is ridiculous to compare the two. Yes, DC is dark and gritty, and yes, Marvel is more humorous, but nowhere is there any direct way to compare and contrast the two in a way that Marvel comes out on top.

I run this shitty blog. But I\u2019m not here to talk about me, i\u2019m here to talk about Joe Hawley, and the rumors surrounding him.\nI found out about these rumors on a Tally Hall server on Discord, which has now turned into rubble. I originally blindly believed claims at first, but then me and a couple of my cohorts looked into it, and we found some inconsistencies.\n1. The supposed public legal documents that prove that he really got a restraining order put against him, don\u2019t seem to exist on the court databases of any state. county, district, or city Joe Hawley was even thinking about going to, and whenever we ask one of the anti-Joe people for these supposedly public legal docs, or even proof that these docs exist, they either completely ignore us, or send us on a wild goose chase through piles of bullshit. These are some major red flags.\n2. Another piece of \u201cevidence\u201d that these anti-Joe people cite is how cryptic and vague Joe responds to questions on Twitter and Instagram messages.First off, just because someone acts nervously when they\u2019re being accused of serious crimes doesn\u2019t mean they are instantly guilty. And also, imagine you\u2019re in Joe Hawley\u2019s shoes. Allegations, true or not, are flying around like crazy, and you are getting a flood of messages all over social media. There are 3 ways to respond to this.\n1. don\u2019t respond as everyone assumes your guilt from your lack of response\n2. respond with a straight answer and get your words taken out of context or possibly even edited to fit the narrative\n3. respond with a vague answer to try and keep everyone happy without incriminating yourself even further\nwhich one would you choose?\n3. Many people also cite messages and emails where Joe\u00a0\u201cadmits to defying a restraining order\u201d. The question is, where? I have never seen these things anywhere, and whenever people cite these, they never provide proof or screencaps when asked. Where in the loving hell are these docs?\nThe only evidence that exists are the anonymous tumblr posts that started all this. the thing is, what will you believe more? the tumblr posters who cite all the same papers that can\u2019t be found in any database that they all got from the same one person they blindly believe? or the people who actually searched for the facts and found nothing? Maybe i\u2019m wrong! Maybe all this actually happened and I\u2019m completely wrong. If so, I will happily apologize and retract my statement.

We identified elements from both printed and recorded ads. In class we watched the top 10 of the best and worst commercials of all time, we observed some awful campaigns that did not accomplish the purpose of promoting and selling the product, having very confusing messages and bizarre elements that sometimes turned out to be annoying for the audience. I really enjoyed the activity where we selected our own \u201cTop 10 Ranking Advertising\u201d as there are many memorable and spectacular advertisements I have seen on TV through the years, so it was interesting analyzing the reasons why I enjoyed them and if they used specific resources to appeal to the audience.\nAfter analyzing the elements of advertising and what makes a successful campaign, now we have started to create our own campaign considering different ethics aspects as well as the message behind what is being presented. This behind meaning can be associated with subtext and discourse as the words and phrases being used are not randomly selected, they have a purpose that is slightly hidden behind the explicit message. In this period we investigated and understood the meaning of discourse, the different types of discourse and their main functions. We also studied the different types of meaning in semantics, topic from which I had heard of but I did not know that there were seven main meanings and how each of them was used.\nIn this unit I learned that it is very important to analyze what we read in our everyday life as constantly messages can have a planned discourse that at first sight we might not identify, therefore contemplating the behind meaning can help us to understand and communicate more successfully our ideas and to critically analyze the real meaning of the information that is presented in front of us."}, {"blog_name": "agent-orosco-blog", "id": 159202038158, "date": "2017-04-04 21:08:52 GMT", "timestamp": 1491340132, "tags": ["transmasculine", "transman", "transboy", "transgender", "discourse", "lgbtq", "please respect us as people", "also if you don't engage in this behavior: congrats this post isn't about you", "but i've seen these kinds of responses so often", "and it makes me feel all kinds of uncomfortable", "men", "boys", "transmen are men", "not babies", "im probably starting a shitstorm with this because it's inevitable on this blue hellsite", "but i just had to get this off my chest"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZpDEbg2KHBb6E", "note_count": 38, "body": "A lot of times when I see posts regarding transmasculine people I see responses like\u00a0\u201cadorable\u201d\u00a0\u201ctoo cute\u201d \u201ctoo pure\u201d \u201ccan I adopt you? uww\u201d etc.\nAnd I gotta say, as a transman myself...that stuff does not sit well with me.\nNow some people might ask\u00a0\u201cbut why though? aren\u2019t those responses positive?

I\u2019m talking about the idea that once someone says or does something that is even slightly\u00a0\u2018incorrect\u2019, they are ruined or irredeemable as a person and have nothing valuable to contribute to society, ever.\nAnd this culture does exist, I\u2019ve seen it on tumblr and in real life. And it\u2019s exhausting to even watch from the sidelines, because you\u2019re forced to participate without even realizing it. If I had a dollar for every time a straight friend prefaced a \nperfectly legitimate\n question about queer people with\u00a0\u201cSorry I don\u2019t know if this is offensive but...\u201d I\u2019d be able to pay my way through college.\nOn a broader note, just because someone has views you don\u2019t agree with doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve never done a good thing in their life. For example, Orson Scott Card is totally homophobic. As in, has-written-essays-about-why-homosexuality-should-be-against-the-law homophobic. Does that mean Ender\u2019s Game isn\u2019t a damn good book? It\u2019s a great book! I love Ender\u2019s Game! Orson Scott Card having shitty opinions on homosexuality doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s a good writer, or that he has very un-shitty opinions about other things!\nIt\u2019s amazing how you see people preach social tolerance and in the same breath publicly condemn and humiliate people for their transgressions. I saw some friends of mine call out a dude on twitter for\u00a0\u2018taking up queer space\u2019 by writing a piece about being an ally for a queer magazine. It\u2019s not like this guy was in any way homophobic, or even talking over queer people. He was so good at staying in his lane he could have won a freaking award for it. And yet they loudly condemned him and anyone who supported him. Y\u2019all, \ntolerance is a two way street\n. Tolerating and accepting people\u2019s differences includes people with different opinions than you. In addition, you don\u2019t get people\u2019s support for your plight by yelling at them, and using the moral high card (\u201dI\u2019m [Oppressed Group] so I\u2019m right\u201d) to just shut down discourse won\u2019t work either. You don\u2019t change anyone\u2019s mind by saying that, and not everyone is an obvious member of a certain group (like white passing POC, in-the-closet queer people, abuse survivors who don\u2019t feel like telling everyone their trauma, etc).\nI\u2019m not saying you should have to spend all your time and energy convincing people of your viewpoints, especially in your daily life and \nespecially\n not in your safe spaces. In addition, it\u2019s hard to know when people- especially people in positions of power- should face sanctions for the mean or shitty things they say. But if you\u2019re in a place where debate is allowed or even expected, such as on social media, in a classroom/seminar, talking with friends and acquaintances, or even calling someone out for whatever shitty things they\u2019re saying, it\u2019s important to listen, actually listen, to what they\u2019re saying. If people are too afraid of getting their heads bitten off to even speak their mind, you won\u2019t know if you need to try changing it. If you don\u2019t know the other side\u2019s rhetoric, how will you know where the flaws in their logic are? A debate isn\u2019t one person shouting down the other, it\u2019s two people being fucking civil and listening to what the other has to say.\nBe kind, y\u2019all."}, {"blog_name": "genjutzu", "id": 173663433425, "date": "2018-05-07 06:23:05 GMT", "timestamp": 1525674185, "tags": ["discourse", "anyways im not quite a fan but like at the same time. hes just having fun at that point in time.", "just to be clear i am not talking about his bullying of deku thats a whole other story"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7tN8a2Xl9RBH", "note_count": 15, "body": "lol I get bakugous a bitch and needs to grow the fuck up but why do ppl just . start bringing up his \"\"lack of foresight\" and shit u can't expect a literal 15 year old to have the best judgement. u know abt brain dev and shit so stop coming up with bullshit lmao\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "enbyfurby", "id": 174051411841, "date": "2018-05-19 15:23:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1526743438, "tags": ["im an asexual person myself", "so if youre aphobic unfollow me", "not hs", "discourse", "???", "i guess", "aphobia", "anti aphobia", "asexual pride", "aromantic pride", "aroace pride", "asexual", "aromantic", "demisexual", "pride"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zchamb2Y6HSU1", "note_count": 38, "body": "Reminder that aphobia is real and will not be tolerated on my blog \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "protectspock", "id": 648658048209059840, "date": "2021-04-16 21:28:40 GMT", "timestamp": 1618608520, "tags": ["txt", "discourse", "ao3"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZUF8sVa0VmxWCm00", "note_count": 60, "body": "Honestly I have a lot of sympathy when I see both \"anti\" or \"anti-anti\" takes when they aren't TOO insane, because I know the \"antis\" have probably witnessed some of the most horrific content the internet had to offer and they are speaking from that emotional place, while I believe many \"anti-antis\" may have lived through the livejournal/ff.net purges of that time and want to protect the relatively new security on Ao3, OR they have had an overly aggressive anti accuse them of being a terrible person for something that really doesn't make them a terrible person and are speaking from THAT emotional place.

and then shiro has a disease?? idfk man listen. im gonna just be listing some little points but theres ya background lol\n1. shiro being gay!\nthe team told us that shiro did have a significant other, and that his sexuality can be interpreted as bi, gay, whatever. and im so fucking down with that??? ive been w lgbt hcs for most if not all the vld characters, including shiro!! he was always bi in my mind, for allura or matt or whoever just bc chemistry. but this influx of mlm shiro just feels... weird. not saying you cant hc him as gay or whatever, but this one tweet about this one stranger that we\u2019ve literally never heard about once is whats setting it off? i lov lov LOV ,my gay brothers n sisters, but damn if it doesnt feel like bi erasure lol!!!!! im not saying everyone who posts gay shiro is a dirty exclusionist but it really feels like we out here, ignoring that bisexual people exist and are precious n beautiful. idk.\n2. allura and girls in general\nso. this might be a touchy topic. but i ALWAYS see this shit. boys and mlm couples in general \nalways\n recieve more attention and love than girls and wlw ships, or just het ships in general. and im not tryna be That Het but jesus christ! i see so many of my fave girls get these years or seasons of development w someone, only to have it overshadowed by one tweet, or one video, or one anything. im really sick and tired of seeing people just go nuts over a pairing that we haven\u2019t really even seen yet, and completely overshadow one thats so well developed and healthy. hhhnhmnh.\n3. shallura in general!\nas i said before, shallura has gotten seasons of constant development. theres ALWAYS something there for us, and i\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty fuckn lucky!! shallura has parallels with two canon couples in the universe, matching themes, colors, its just really apparent to me that theyre endgame!! or, were- idk where the crew is going with this. but anyway, the introduction of adam, even though the crew has told us theyd been thinking about it for a while, feels so rushed. almost exactly like matts arrival, but worse. yall know how hard shallura has had to fight to be a popular ship? it wasn\u2019t so bad in the beginning, but it still kind of sucked being second to klance. then matt came along, and shatt became a thing, and shallura went under the water yet again. we\u2019ve been pretty steady, but this whole adam thing has just dropped the popularity, and i dont even know why. we know nothing about adam other than his appearance and that he and shiro were a couple. its either this fandom has a PHAT distaste for allura, or just shallura. i dont know, but its jus. annoying. a bunch of the popular shallura blogs are being really gracious and nice about it, but shadam fans seem to be jumping on that opportunity to erase allura and shiros relationship completely and go back to shipping their uwu gaybies!! im willing to give shadam a chance, but im just displeased now because i feel like the fandom is way overreacting. we know nothing about him. \ni probably forgot a few things but thats kind of all my opinions. hoo. im heated. hope you enjoyed the rant :ppp"}, {"blog_name": "lovej0ys", "id": 655537567689850880, "date": "2021-07-01 19:55:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1625169341, "tags": ["discourse", "/nm ^_^", ".text"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZyM2JVaOx-7J4y00", "note_count": 29, "body": "c!dream apologists writing their essays on tumblr like hi all this is my coming out story "}, {"blog_name": "thyrell", "id": 149558453191, "date": "2016-08-27 16:11:53 GMT", "timestamp": 1472314313, "tags": ["terfs /", "discourse", "radfem /", "fun fact I still hate terfs", "I'm in a very terf-hating mood rn", "just saw some terfy posts"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zxq9Vn2BIOEF7", "note_count": 274, "body": "reblog to punch ur local terf"}, {"blog_name": "roxilalonde", "id": 156740590567, "date": "2017-02-03 02:49:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1486090155, "tags": ["please stop sending me messages about it now", "vriscourse", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZJRO_f2H_Tvld", "note_count": 11, "body": "i can\u2019t believe i\u2019m making this post but in light of recent vriscourse i thought i should make my position on the matter clear so that those who want to start shit over a joke post will look elsewhere\ni do not and never have argued that vriska serket did nothing wrong, or that manipulation is the only constitutive property of a) a toxic person, or b) an abuser"}, {"blog_name": "s-h-i-t-s-u-j-i", "id": 680396408091803648, "date": "2022-04-02 05:16:19 GMT", "timestamp": 1648876579, "tags": ["self help", "discourse", "anger issues", "stubborn", "vent"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0s04SbnGEsYmu00", "note_count": 0, "body": "Ten Minute Rule\nIf you're in a heated argument with someone that is going nowhere and causing you distress, but you feel like you can't/don't want to stop fighting, I offer you the ten minute rule:\nIf they don't respond in ten minutes or less block.\nIf you can't find yourself coming up with the will to write a response back in ten minutes or less block.\nIf you can't stop feeling pissed in ten minutes or less block.\nIt's not worth it.

I have many friends from either very conservative families, or the South / Midwest, or other countries like China and Malaysia who have told me the only reason they had any kind of knowledge about sex is the Internet. Without \u201cthe talk,\u201d or any formal/ comprehensive /accurate school sex ed,\u00a0 they relied on the Internet and magazines (like Cosmo, god forbid) to learn about what was actually going on in their bodies and relationships. At least a few of them have also been in shitty or sexually manipulative relationships / experienced assault / or even just really bad and painful (and definitely not fun) sex with literally no context for the fact that things shouldn\u2019t be like that.\nExplicit tumblr is actually great for correct, inclusive, sex-positive, kink-positive sex ed--better than reddit or Google as you don\u2019t really have to know what to search in order to find what you\u2019re looking for. Plus, the social justice bent of the whole place makes it highly likely that where you find porn or posts about sex, you also find an expression of the fact that consent is important (and how to get/give consent), sex is also about pleasure (not just procreation), virginity is a shitty construct, sex can be safe (and in what ways), and that sex / menstruation/ masturbation / LGBTQA+ relationships and identity / etc is natural and nothing to be ashamed of. Also, along with this information, posts about positive/healthy relationships are everywhere and often come up when you find the more educational /discourse-driven posts about sex. And really, the only thing you have to know to find this kind of information is the word\u00a0\u201csex\u201d--the search bar brings up all of the kinds of posts I just mentioned, when you search that word only.\u00a0\nso yeah.

This is ultimately their decision, and I respect that.\nHowever, the reason I am still uncomfortable with the conclusion of these events is how Mod May handled the accusations of racism against bottomsona.\nFirst, why are people accusing bottomsona of racism?\nThe blog has a history of white mods speaking over people of color. Although Mod S is now gone, \nthis post\n has a white person saying headcanons of Asian men as ace are bad because it plays into the desexualization of Asian men. \nThis ask\n is an example of the current and only mod saying something similar, calling these headcanons\u00a0\u201cinherently problematic\u201d.\u00a0\nThe main problem with this argument is that it shifts the blame of the desexualization of Asian men from white people (like bottomsona) to aces, including Asian aces that would like to see themselves represented. It allows white people to get away with feeling like an ally without actually correcting the underlying racist beliefs that desexualize Asian men in the first place. Other problems include the erasure of aces of color and the desexualization of asexuality (which removes our sexual agency).\nHere\u2019s a more in-depth explanation\n from yours truly on why this headcanon argument is wrong. If you prefer, \nhere\u2019s a different response\n explaining why bottomsona is overstepping their place.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a link\n (you can check out the notes) to many, many other people with the same sentiment.\nThis response\n is especially appalling\u00a0because the discussion of racism is between two white people. Neither bottomsona nor the anon should be making the comparison of \u201ccishet\u201d aces to racist white people. Also, aces aren\u2019t an inherently privileged group, unlike white people, so if they wanted to just say \u201ccishets\u201d, they should have just said \u201ccishets\u201d.\nIn conclusion, white people speaking over people of color is racist, regardless of the headcanon discourse.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the problem with acewlws\u2019s response?\nMod May is white, as noted in the\u00a0\u201cmods\u201d section of their about. The \noriginal ask\n to acewlws criticizing bottomsona included racism as one of the reasons. Mod May reasonably asked for \nreceipts\n, however, when they were provided, her only response was\u00a0\u201c\nI\u2019m white, so I can\u2019t comment on them much\n\u201c.\nThis is an inappropriate response from a white person to people of color saying something is racist.\u00a0\nAs I said in \nmy response to acewlws\n, saying\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m white, so I can\u2019t comment on them much\u201d dismisses the racism. Mod May\u2019s comment implied that she didn\u2019t think it was racist, as I highly doubt she would have made the same comment on something more obvious. However, the ask wasn\u2019t looking for Mod May\u2019s opinion on if it was racist or not. A person of color had already determined it was racist, and it\u2019s not up to a white person to contend that. Think about it\u2014if a gay person tells a straight person something is homophobic, would you want the straight person to say\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t comment\u201d? White people need to trust people of color in determining what is racist or not. Otherwise, you are implying that we are not capable of understanding our own experiences.\u00a0\nIn their final post, there was no mention of racism, despite being one of the initial complaints. Acewlws never responded to my comment, either. This means this issue was almost entirely ignored.\u00a0\nI don\u2019t think Mod May was intentionally racist, nor do I think she is a racist person. However, this should be an opportunity for her (and other white people) to think more critically about how they respond. Discussions of race can be uncomfortable, and I know there are concerns about staying in one\u2019s lane. But disregarding claims of racism is not the way to combat it.

Because there is a separation between cc and character, but the lines can get blurry sometimes so if you ever feel like what you\u2019re doing might make the cc uncomfortable, it might be better to not do it at all. And use your common sense. If a cc has their character in relationships or acting romantically with other characters it\u2019s pretty obvious they don\u2019t have issues with that interpretation."}, {"blog_name": "moldy-junk", "id": 160293422177, "date": "2017-05-04 07:38:52 GMT", "timestamp": 1493883532, "tags": ["negative", "su", "fandom critical", "discourse", "tw abuse mention", "i'm so tired...."], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z8ZMEy2LIEuHX", "note_count": 104, "body": "Saying\u00a0\u201cHolly Blue abused Jasper\u201d is just as bad as saying\u00a0\u201cJasper abused Lapis\u201d, in my humble opinion.\u00a0\nNeither\n of these claims are supported by canon, so stop being a hypocritical asshat."}, {"blog_name": "cupochamomile", "id": 172047218886, "date": "2018-03-19 22:43:35 GMT", "timestamp": 1521499415, "tags": ["cookie run", "discourse", "ask to tag"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZDqS1d2WEq3Z6", "note_count": 11, "body": "Y'all act like posting pedophilic and transmisogynistic shit is the cooler option and call us overly upset when we say \"hey that's kinda fucked up!\" But then go parading how \"not upset you are about how we're upset and how much you definitely don't care about what we say\" almost as if....

I would like to write a long detailed response, but I'm honestly super tired. \nWhat I will say is that Empress was a good friend of mine on this site. She was one of the first people that I followed and interacted with when I joined the reylo fandom back in 2017. She always had my back and supported me (and the rest of us) when it came to dealing with antis. I didn't always agree with some of her more  political opinions but I respected them. \nThat being said, what she did was very wrong and not respectful in the slightest. Naturally when I first heard about the doxxing I had the knee-jerk reaction of taking her side and defending her (because she was my friend and I trusted that she wouldn't do something like that). When I learned about what she did to Evil I was shocked. That was inappropriate on her part and she really had no need to take it that far in regards to her squabble with evil-shenanigans. I stood by her with her callout post, because I did have issues with Malevolent Reverie's fics, but honestly the feud should have just stopped there and not gone any further. But it just escalated and went downhill from there. \nSo while I am dissapointed I won't stop being her friend. And I am grateful that she realized how wrong she was and apologized to both Evil and the rest b of the fandom. I only regret not being around to talk to her about it. \nAs for @thisissosad-alexa-playdespacito, I'm very sorry about what happened. Your privacy shouldn't have been violated and I'm sorry that you feel unsafe and shaken. You didn't deserve that. No one does. I apologize for not reaching out to you personally earlier. I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable here. If you'd like to keep your distance and not respond to me or my mutuals again I understand.

Its how and who they are in Runeterra. Its a fantasy world, why would they need to address it beyond stating their love? There was no need to make it a thing and they didn\u2019t.

They are fighting evil from the inside out and they are in an unfair battle but theyre winning and they are LOVING EACHOTHER the whole time. At the end of Act 3, Val says to his mother that they will find a way to be separated and destroy varus. And his mother says she will be waiting with love for the two of them. Will that happen? We can\u2019t say for certain. Personally, I believe the 5 darkin will reunite for riot to open up for making more darkin or possibly a huge event.

I came out and identified as trans before I started experiencing dysphoria. I even felt more comfortable in and secure about my identity before I started experiencing dysphoria. once I started experiencing dysphoria is when I started questioning whether or not I was \"\"really trans\"\" and whether or not I was just somehow \"\"faking\"\" it for attention, even though I logically knew that I didn't WANT attention and I knew that the hardships trans people faced weren't something I wanted. \nmy dysphoria didn't just pop up and cause me to be like \"welp guess I'm trans now since I hate my body,\" it manifested and made me think \"oh no what if this isn't real what if I'm pretending even though I don't know why I'd pretend what if I'm imagining the way being correctly addressed makes me feel.\" I realized I was trans when I had friends online and offline start addressing me differently than my agab, the first time my friends used my chosen name (at the time) and my chosen pronouns I was filled with an unexplainable joy that I could not put into words. when people would (in their view) misidentify me as something other than a girl I wasn't upset, and that was a weird feeling. it made me sit down and think that maybe there's a reason I'm not upset when called a boy, because while I didn't \nmind \nbeing called a girl, it still didn't make me \nhappy. \ndysphoria is not the only way to realize you're trans. dysphoria is not a requirement of being trans. pushing that only hurts trans people and makes it harder for us to come to terms with our identity and accept who we really are. I am still struggling with this among other things even though I started identifying as trans when I was 13-14 years old, and I'm turning 20 in less than 6 months. I shouldn't be forced into a box that I don't want to be in just to please trandmeds while making myself miserable.\nbeing trans should not be based on how miserable you feel, and I'm so tired of being told that how bad I feel is a measurement of just how trans I am.

I have a side blog for NSFW stuff, mostly focused on my own writing and discussion of my own sexuality. I am going to post this on both my main and my side blog since there\u2019s been drama recently that involves intersection between fandom and kink. These points apply to both communities.\nRecently a certain individual who does \u201cvore\u201d art of Gravity Falls characters has been at the center of drama for posting \u2018vore\u2019 related art in a ship tag and drawing hate for the content that has spilled over into \u2018vore blogs\u2019. The person in question is sexist, transphobic, weirdly homophobic (like he reblogs lesbian fanart and them misgenders one of them, insisting one of them is a \u2018guy\u2019 and drawn weird for a \u2018guy\u2019), and intentionally tries to hurt other people by using slurs and suicide baiting. I in no way support them, and recommend blocking them. (they\u2019ve probably managed to piss off people who ship Gravity Falls, and people who like vore). \nHowever, I want to use this as an opportunity to make something clear, \nas someone who supports shipping whatever you want to ship\n and likes vore\u00a0\nIf you like kink material keep it out of non-kink tags.\nIf you hate kink material ignore/avoid kink-tags. \nOn Ethics: \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying fiction or art even if you enjoy things that other people find uncomfortable, disgusting or disturbing. That including shipping things that would never happen in canon and wouldn\u2019t be health in real life. That also includes having weird kinks and writing content focused on that fantasy.\nAll content must be tagged\n so people can avoid what they don\u2019t want to see.\nAvoid what you don\u2019t want to see/don\u2019t go looking for things you find disturbing in order to \nharass or bully people who enjoy it\nKeep content that others find disturbing out of main tags\n \nIf you have a kink for something others find disturbing, do not tag kink related content as \u2018ship tag\u2019 so that everyone who ships that pairing is bombarded with content that\u2019s A) unrelated to their ship and B) highly disturbing. Furthermore, the creators of the kink content now have work they wrote associated with a ship when that was not the intention of their work and they may find the ship repulsive. \nFandom related tags are for fandom related content. While there are generic \u2018imagine your OTP\u2019 any imagine your OTP prompts that are kink focused should probably be given their own tag. Fanart or fanfic containing kinks which may disturb others should be given their own tag so that they don\u2019t appear on the number #tag or at least be put under a read-more with a warning. \nIf you ship a non-canon pairing I think it\u2019s probably good etiquette to keep that out of the main fandom tag although in that case there\u2019s more opportunity to block content. Someone who doesn\u2019t like Kylo Ren/Rei may reasonably expect it might pop up in the Star Wars tag and can preemptively blacklist it, but no one knows every bizarre kink in existence and shouldn\u2019t have to deal with it on the tag. \nI do not what anyone likes or writes or draws but I do care about respecting other people\u2019s boundaries. \nOn Shipping\n: \nThere are many motives behind enjoying a pairing and rarely if ever is the motive a reflection of poor moral character (i.e. I ship Rose and Pearl because I think unhealthy dynamics are great or I ship Sailor Moon and Tuxedo mask because I think age-gaps are the best thing ever). Liking something in fiction is not the same as being an abuser IRL or supporting abuse IRL and the notion it does is offensive. \nI have a friend who ships Bill and Dipper from Gravity Falls. She is not a child molester, she not abusive, she does not support any sort of abuse whatsoever. She\u2019s a girl who likes comic books and cartoons and cosplaying villains and trickers. Her best friend cosplayed Dipper to her Bill, and she ships Bill and Dipper because it reminds her of playing around with her best friend during cons and photoshoots. \nAs kids we play pretend and make our own stories \u201cLet\u2019s play Jurassic Park\u201d - my cousin Mikey says, he\u2019s 6 and the only one brave enough enough to have actually watched the movie. My cousin and I are 5 and 4. \u201cI\u2019m a raptor!\u201d Mikey declares, hunching over and doing his best dinosaur impression. \u201cCan we be T-Rexes, Rex means King so that makes us Dinosaur Princesses!\u201d \u00a0I say, and my cousin echoes me.\nYears pass and games change, \u201cI\u2019m Peter Pan\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re in Narnia\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Tarzan\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Jedi\u201d \u201cPikachu!\u201d Playing out stories from movies mixed with imagination, treasuring Men-In-Black Happy Meal toys that come with classes and \u2018memory flashy-thing\u2019. \nAs we grow older we stop playing (the exceptionally geeky limit playing to LARPs or joking around \u2018in character\u2019 with friends during cosplay) but in writing and art we can still make up stories and \u2018play-pretend\u2019. Except now we\u2019re older so the stories we want to tell have changed, we like romance or horror or dark romance that blends genres. The \u201cBill\u201d my friend ships with \u201cDipper\u201d is no more a representation of canon than playing \u201cdinosaur Princess\u201d is an accurate representation of the plot of Jurassic Park. \nAt the end of the day it\u2019s just play pretend and story telling. \nOn Fetish: \nMore out there/disturbing kinks exist as the brain\u2019s reaction to something disturbing. If something upsets you at a young age to the extent that it produces extreme emotions be it fear or disgust it can create a phobia. However, sometimes, your brain reacts in a way that crosses wire where fear becomes fascination/attraction. These connections are made around age 5 or so as in way before any wiring regarding sexual or romantic attraction exists and sometimes when those wires do develop the fascination/attraction wiring connects to the sexual/romantic attraction wiring resulting in enjoying something that there is no logical reason to enjoy and more often than not is something you should find frightening or disgusting (since the root of the \u2018kink\u2019 was being frightened or disgusted).\nFor example, a friend who saw Star Wars when they were too young to watch something so violent was very upset by the frequent dismemberment, including seeing Luke having his hand cut off. It was so upsetting \u00a0that the brain responded by rewiring which in their case didn\u2019t end up in a phobia but in an fascination and later a very weird disturbing fetish. They don\u2019t want to hurt anyone, they don\u2019t think that cutting people\u2019s arms off is good or that it would be good to have their hand cut off, but they enjoy completely fictional depictions of violence (fan art, movies, written works).\nScary/messed up kinks are less scary when you realize they are often rooted in something totally innocent \u2018a little kid watching Star Wars and being afraid of scary things\u2019 and their brain trying to make them feel better but mixing up some wires along the way. So having a fetish/kink doesn\u2019t make you a bad person.\nIn terms of sexual morality as long as what you\u2019re doing is consensual it\u2019s not wrong. Consensual means that everyone involved agrees, so if you actually seriously hurt someone that would be wrong or if you expressed enjoying someone\u2019s actual pain that would be wrong because that\u2019s using them without their consent. However, enjoying a gory horror film isn\u2019t wrong, even if you enjoy it in a way that is very weird. \nSaying to someone who was attacked by a shark. \u201cMan that\u2019s hot, I have this thing for blood\u201d Is sexual harassment in the same way that saying to a woman in with large breasts \u201cMan that\u2019s hot, I have this thing for curvy girls\u201d is sexual harassment. The former is definitely more disturbing because that\u2019s not normal and it\u2019s expressing happiness over something that caused you pain, but both statements are sexual harassment. Weird Kinks aren\u2019t an issue, violating someone\u2019s consent is an issue. \nOn Fandom:\nFandom is a shared space and can be an expressive space with room for people to explore every possible desire. Since most people in fandom are women or people with marginalized sexualities fandom can create a space to explore things they wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable experimenting with on their own. I knew a catholic school girl who confessed to her Priest that she wrote Narnia Slash and the Priest\u2019s take was that she was far worse and that she was much more likely to be hurt by exploring her attraction to boys with IRL boys than by writing about attraction to men or about sex itself. Another friend was a middle aged mom who still kept alt accounts for any explicit fics because she didn\u2019t want \nher mother\n to find out she\u2019d written \u201cinappropriate things\u201d. Years before I came out as bi I wrote bisexual characters and explored things I wasn\u2019t ready to consider in real life. \nIn terms of kink, fandom is the safest place to explore it. While some kinks can\u2019t be played out IRL (imaginary kinks spawned by horror film that are too dangerous or simply impossible), others can with role-play or engagement in certain scenes but not without risk. If a girl has a fantasy of being dominated by a powerful bad guy it\u2019s far safer that she explore that by writing stories or draw pictures of Sephiroth or Kylo Ren than to seeking out an IRL DOM. Not that BDSM can\u2019t be done safely, but that trusting another human being comes with risk and any relationship can potentially be abusive, and a relationship where you put yourself in a position of helplessness it would follow might have greater risk. Furthermore, for many people fantasies are just that: fantasies. \nJust as someone who enjoys reading about battles and action scenes might have no desire to be a in a war or someone who loves medical dramas might have no desire to ever work in a hospital, someone who likes romance full of angst or terrifying power/dynamics they find thrilling to read may have no desire to role-play this in real life (though if they do that\u2019s fine, if it\u2019s normal for guys to want their girlfriend to dress in Leia in a gold bikini then a girlfriend should be able say \u2018ok so you\u2019re Kylo Ren and I\u2019m strapped to the table, how will you make me give you what you want\u2019 - because it\u2019s ok for girls to have fantasies and play with their sexuality as long as it\u2019s consensual and safe). \u00a0\nWriting or creating fan art is the ultimate safe consensual place to explore anything. Those creating works consent to play out a fantasy by putting it down on paper (or screen in this case) and those who read/view the works consent to read them/view them by choosing to look/read and can revoke their consent at any time by closing out. There\u2019s no risk that something will keep going after they\u2019re uncomfortable. This is why tags are necessary to help people who like something find it and to help those who don\u2019t like it avoid it."}, {"blog_name": "pockopeas", "id": 655905214797430784, "date": "2021-07-05 21:19:17 GMT", "timestamp": 1625519957, "tags": ["dont rb", "discourse", "mcyttwt", "negativity", "negative", "twitter", "if they dont interact with you then dont interact.", "screenshot and crop the user and move on", "if they ARE interacting then go fucking ham", "but don't @ them lmao"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZotaTjaQFb5MKy00", "note_count": 19, "body": "i do feel like some people start too much shit in technotwt. why do we care so much. chill out guys."}, {"blog_name": "dreamglitched", "id": 663122472834646016, "date": "2021-09-23 13:14:30 GMT", "timestamp": 1632402870, "tags": ["discourse", "fandom critical"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZEe5HTapuc0huq00", "note_count": 21, "body": "Everytime Dream logs on with a character other than c!Dream people get all up in arms about him being in a silly goofy mood and wanting the roleplay to end so he doesn\u2019t have to do switch accounts to do that.\u00a0\nDream chose narratively to play the villain and have his character yeeted into prison.

I get that. Many of the accomplishments people listed were things I would never accomplish, let alone want to. When I reflected on my own list I could contribute, I realized that many of my \u201caccomplishments\u201d are rather small. But that\u2019s okay. I will never have a PhD, most likely, and home ownership is all but off the table despite it being a huge dream of mine because I struggle to hold even a part time job, let alone the kind of job you\u2019d need for a mortgage. And you know what? That\u2019s okay.\nMy autism diagnosis made me realize that there are things I am always going to struggle with. I\u2019m not going to \u201cgrow out\u201d of the struggling, nor am I going to just \u201cget over it\u201d one day like everyone expects. My accomplishments are not going to look like everyone else\u2019s. And yeah, it hurts, especially when you compare yourself to friends/family members/peers. \nBut I didn\u2019t take the meme as a competition to see who was the Best Autistic, or Best At Passing As NT. I took it in the spirit of being proud of what I have accomplished and being understanding towards what I haven\u2019t, even if my struggles were everyone else\u2019s baseline accomplishment level. \nThe creator of the original post has nothing to apologize for, even if some found the idea in poor taste. (Turns out it wasn\u2019t an \u201cidea\u201d for everyone to compete scores, it was just a personal tweet whose format went viral in the community.) The thing is, we are all oppressed in one way and privileged in another. As tempting as it is to cry and whine about oppression and how ableist it is to speak of accomplishments (because SOMEONE SOMEWHERE will not be able to accomplish that same thing), maybe we can take a moment to think about our own privilege and how we can acknowledge the ways we\u2019ve been given a hand up in our own lives.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s been a lot of screaming about this meme that I think would be better directed elsewhere. If you felt injured by another autistic person sharing that they have a PhD, why? Do YOU need one to be a valuable person? No. Of course not. Just live your best life and stop feeling the need to compare yourself to others. It\u2019s your journey, no one else\u2019s. If you find the meme in poor taste simply move on or contribute with your actual accomplishments, no matter how small. There\u2019s no reason to feel *hurt* about what strangers are saying about their own lives. \nSay it with me:\nYOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN FEELINGS AND REACTIONS.\nNot the original poster, not the meme, not everybody\u2019s responses, not what someone has or has not accomplished. \nIt\u2019s okay to feel the meme was in poor taste and choose not to contribute, but blaming anyone because YOU felt bad or hurt by what people were sharing is on you, not them. \n(A note about my use of the word \u201cmeme\u201d to describe the post everyone is doing: since the original poster has made it clear that the format of the post was intended to accommodate their own needs in structuring their idea, and since it was meant to be a single observation about a single person rather than a copy-paste post for everyone to do and compare against each other, the use of the word \u201cmeme\u201d might be inappropriate contextually.\nHowever, it took off as a meme because the format made it easy for people to post their own accomplishment/struggles. It was read as a meme from the moment it was retweeted and shared and thus went viral, which is how these things go. While the original creator may not have intended it as a meme, a meme is what it became.\nI have also deliberately not referenced any of the involved parties out of respect to those involved, because this is not a call out post to anyone. Just me observing the behavior involved in the fallout.)\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "baka-monarch", "id": 674276613743050752, "date": "2022-01-24 16:04:48 GMT", "timestamp": 1643040288, "tags": ["rambles", "discourse", "tw discourse", "fandom critical", "fandom neg"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZXULpWbRWm7wWW00", "note_count": 7, "body": "Every now and then I remember that thing that happened (I didn't see it happen but I heard about it) where there was an entire discourse of people that got mad about c!Wilbur being \"dehumanized\"/\"villainized\" with the red eyes design and because of it people changed their entire c!Wilbur design to have red sunglasses instead\nBut like- guys- why did you make that argument about c!Wilbur when red eyes are used for loads of characters that aren't even evil, but there's no argument about how people shouldn't be drawing c!Dream with glowing green eyes (specifically the unnaturally glowing green eyes) when in theater and media green light throughout history has always been used to signify a monster and/or villain\nIf you're gonna do that for one character why not do it for all the characters that end up being treated like that? c!Quackity has been given red eyes before, c!Sam has been given BOTH red eyes and unnaturally glowing green eyes before, c!Techno has been given red eyes before- what are you accomplishing by only arguing about c!Wilbur and how you want him to still be seen as the most purest pure bean ever?

Is it maybe because feminine-ascribed traits are shameful and bad because they are traditionally tied to women, whereas being a man/being masculine is fine?\nLet's get something straight. Wearing skirts/painting your nails/being \"soft\" etc. are only considered feminine because of a history of strictly separated gender roles based on - you guessed it! - misogyny. There is nothing inherently feminine about these things, nor is it offensive to draw a male CC in a fucking skirt or HC them as \"soft\". What\n is\n offensive is implying that traits connected to traditional femininity are something so shameful that they shouldn't be associated with male CCs even just for fun.

The person I came with has been swallowed into the sea of college-aged camaraderie, and I find everybody else here insufferable. I know that sounds pretentious, but discomfort sometimes brings out my bad side.\u00a0\nWanting to avoid any more feigned conversation, I maneuver my way into a corner and take out my phone. Immediately I feel swaddled in the security it offers. Wanting to make it known that I am closing myself off from any semblance of social interaction, I open Instagram and begin scrolling through my feed, sealing myself off from the people around me and affording myself once again, sweet, sweet privacy.\u00a0\nSocial media is typically discussed in terms of an increased publicity; that these new media platforms have enhanced our ability to publicly communicate and present ourselves. But what if you never share a thing? What if you are on the outside looking in? Then what does social media offer you? While social media and cell phones have undoubtedly increased the publicity of our lives, they mark a shift away from traditional public discourse, and have also allowed us to be more private, more secluded, and more removed from public society. The lines between public and private, however, are now much harder to distinguish, and have been muddied as a result of the new discourse of social media.\u00a0\nI often think about what I would do if it were 1970, and if I didn\u2019t have this thing in my pocket that acts as a rescue inhaler for introverts. What did my dad do if he wanted to avoid a conversation? I certainly inherited my introverted nature from him, but I\u2019m lucky (in more ways than one) in that I have an escape\u2014did he? Would he have been forced to talk to people even when he didn\u2019t want to? In a way, that almost seems like the better option. I\u2019m sure being forced to participate in a public discourse would be useful for many people to develop those interpersonal skills, a lack of which cripples them so. But often the temptation to subvert five minutes of discomfort is undeniable. I would much rather be cloaked in cell-phone-induced privacy than to be forced to feign interaction. And I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s the right choice.\u00a0\nWe see this happening all the time. On the subway, in restaurants, on the street: people looking down at a screen. If you\u2019re somebody who doesn\u2019t have a phone, they must all look like aliens, in a trance over a device the size of their hand, dividing their attention between existing in the real world and in the virtual. I was at work just the other day, and in the break room there is a table with benches on either side. Myself and three of my coworkers were seated at the table in relatively close quarters. This was a plastic picnic table\u2014something that is perhaps designed to stimulate conversation. But rather than talking, all four of us were staring at a phone, removed from our togetherness, and blocking ourselves off from interacting with each other.\u00a0\nIs this living in private killing our ability to socialize in public? Alexandra Ossola of The Atlantic seems to think so. She writes that in 2009, Tamyra Pierce, a journalism professor at California State University, Fresno conducted a study to test the relationship between technology and social anxiety. She asked teenagers how often they use \u201csocially interactive technologies,\u201d like instant messages and texts, and then assessed how comfortable they felt talking to people face-to-face. Pierce found that the more the students spent using online communication methods, the more likely they were to show symptoms of anxiety about communicating face-to-face (Ossola, 2015). It seems obvious that an increasingly privatized life would lead to difficulty interacting in public, and it seems that the problem feeds into itself by using technology as an escape from the opportunity to develop those skills. The privacy offered by cell phones and social media may actually be shutting the door on developing the skills necessary to live in public, and to interact with others.\u00a0\nAnd I know that this is not a new behavior. People used to read newspapers, listen to personal radios, or distract themselves with whatever else they had available to them. But cell phones have become so ubiquitous that many people\u2014myself included\u2014feel an inability to exist without them. When so much of what we do is rooted in the phone, it can be intimidating to leave it at home and navigate the world without it. \n\nMaybe the compulsion to stare at Instagram on the subway is rooted in an increasing desire to stay active in the public sphere, and to stay aware and up-to-date with what your friends and the people you care about are doing. Maybe it\u2019s in the desire to distract yourself from the people sitting around you, and to give yourself something to stare at until you get to your stop. In either case, I wanted to find out for myself.\u00a0\nI consider myself a heavy social media user. Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram are all platforms I find myself going to regularly throughout the day, either out of boredom or a real desire to see what\u2019s been going on. I often found myself looking at them compulsively, even when I had already consumed all that there was available. Out of discomfort for the ways these social media applications had me trapped, I deleted them. There would be no more compulsive checking, or scrolling, or consuming. I was eager to see how long it would take for the compulsion to resurface and demand that I re-install them.\u00a0\nTo my surprise, no such compulsion was felt. I went the entire summer without opening, without checking, without distractedly scrolling, and without missing the feeling of always being connected with the world around me. It was a bizarre feeling, to go from such a heavy involvement to suddenly none. But, at the same time, it was a relief. I was suddenly free. I lived life without knowing what others were doing. And in a way, I felt more privacy than I ever had before. Living without the crutch that affords me the ability to avoid the public actually led to a greater shift away from it. I\u2019ve since gone back to using these social media apps, but it\u2019s getting to a point again where I feel the need to get rid of them, and go back to truly living privately.\u00a0\nSo how does social media actually inform the divide between public and private? It would seem difficult to argue that we are allowed truly increased privacy as a result of social media, especially after my experience living without it, but this is both true and not. It\u2019s not like there is a shortage of things to distract yourself with on an iPhone, it just seems that social media applications are the preferred method of doing so. And really, almost any application you can look at on a phone involves some version of living publicly. In almost every way, cell phones mark an increase in the publicity of our lives.\u00a0\nI hate to keep going back to Instagram, but it\u2019s such a succinct example of how publicity manifests itself on social media. I follow 248 people on Instagram, most of them being personal friends and acquaintances. Scrolling through my feed, I see things from almost every person\u2019s daily life. Lauren got coffee, Emily went to the beach, George has a show tonight at 10:30. Even if I never share anything from my own life, being aware of these events puts one in a position of drastically increased publicity. Without the app to inform me of the daily lives of others, I live outside the new public sphere of social media.\u00a0\nPublicity on Instagram, however, is much different from the old concept of publicity. Publicity, as J\u00fcrgen Habermas might put it, consists of a network of deliberating individuals who interact on a personal level. Publicity took place in reality, in face-to-face interactions, and in spoken conversations between parties. Publicity to Habermas could only take place in public, in the physical presence of others, interacting and sharing and exchanging ideas. Now, however, the terms are slightly different, and Instagram has muddied the lines between what can be considered public and private.\u00a0\nImagine I make an Instagram post from the privacy of my bedroom. It could be of anything: what I had for lunch, something I did over the weekend, or any other thing I feel like sharing. I sit in my bed and watch as my peers \u201clike\u201d the image, signifying their recognition of my personal life. Am I living in public in this moment? Or am I still in private? Am I publicly in private or vice versa? What if I share a private moment on Instagram? Does it become public in its nature by being on social media, or is it still allowed the distinction of a private moment? I\u2019ll stop the questions there, but Instagram and social media in general makes it hard to distinguish between what is truly private and truly public. It used to be easy; either you\u2019re by yourself or you\u2019re interacting with others. But when you\u2019re doing both, as we are now allowed to do, the distinction isn\u2019t so clear.\u00a0\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t worry so much about these kinds of things. Maybe there\u2019s nothing wrong with pulling my phone out at a party to escape the awkwardness and discomfort I\u2019m feeling. Maybe discourse should be allowed to evolve naturally without me commenting on the way things are moving. But it seems awfully dishonest.\u00a0\nI try not to look at my phone on the subway anymore. I try to look at the things around me, at the people around me, to be a part of my environment. But they\u2019re all staring down at their phones, too. Maybe it\u2019s a lost cause.\nSources\nOssola, Alexandra. \nA New Kind of Social Anxiety in the Classroom\n. The Atlantic, 15 Jan 2015. \ntheatlantic.com\n.

It can come off as a little corny and/or disingenuous sometimes, but this would be fine if it were on its own.\nBut it isn\u2019t. Because the whole other side of tumblr is negativity. There\u2019s this attitude going around that it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d to be suffering, and \u201cinteresting and unique\u201d to have mental illnesses. While acceptance of these problems should be commonplace in society, this is not how to go about it. The culture tumblr is perpetuating right now is that if you aren\u2019t struggling constantly, you aren\u2019t struggling at all. If you\u2019re going through a happy period in life, the environment here makes you feel like you shouldn\u2019t be, like you need to be consistently unhappy or in pain to have people pay attention to you. This isn\u2019t the case in the real world, and it shouldn\u2019t be here.\nInstead, this is a place where you should feel free to talk about these problems without the burden of outside pressure. It should be a place where you\u2019re able to talk about your struggles without feeling the need to over-dramatize or flaunt them. Because as this site\u2019s evolved it\u2019s become more than just a place for fandoms to gather or for memes to be created: people talk about serious things on here too.\nI guess I don\u2019t have a solution to all of this.

It is a book about housewife-ish sentiments, about staying at home and being someone who takes care of the home, but not really a homemaker because you are wealthy enough to employ a maid and nannies, but you kinda do stuff here and there, anyways what you\u2019re really fiery about is those damn feminists who are always trying to get women to do high-stress career jobs when it\u2019s not what makes women happy and fulfilled like you (?) so they must be stopped. It is a book with a lot, I mean a lot of internalized dissonances. Logically inconsistent worldviews. A value \u2026 conglomeration with divergent values, that tries to be a value system when it\u2019s not fighting itself. Enough intelligence to recognize this and hate itself for it. And this is coming from ME, who kept curated lists of cognitive dissonances as a teenager.\nShe at times\n- decries feminism for glorifying career work for women\n- decries rich women for supporting a system where underpaid black and brown women work for no benefits and no Social Security net\n- \u00a0decries millennials for not knowing basic household skills that her mother from the 1950s could do blindfolded\nWhen she wasn\u2019t shitting on feminism, she would be shitting on herself, and her inability to run a home like her own mother did. She is also\nDisappointed in herself for also not having those household skills\nHates that she needs a nanny to help take care of the kids\nFeels unfulfilled and depressed staying at home taking care of young twin children\nPraises feminism for forcing employment law to consider domestic workers as employees, rather than independent contractors, because it means that paying your domestic help under the table and hence not giving them Social Security is illegal\nI should have known going into the book, when she started off the book with the incredulous claim that feminism began in the 1960s, that this woman had no clue what feminism was.\u00a0It really feels like an emotional state and worldview borne entirely of (negative) reactionism. \nI do wonder why I\u2019m reading it. I felt awkward reading it on the subway and tried to hide it when reading it at work, because the subtitle is \u2018Loving and Loathing our Inner Housewife\u2019 and I don\u2019t want someone to point to me at work and scream MILKSHAKE DUCK or some crap. I\u2019m quite nervous about sharing how I feel about current social movements in a public setting. I feel the childlike terror of social ostracization and I\u2019m too nervous to handle people not liking me. \nI want to say that, maybe if James Damore was actually centrally concerned about the welfare of other people rather than being technically correct, I do think he expounded an underlying point about not necessarily expecting equivalent numbers of men and women to go into the field of computer science, even after equal access to technology and equal treatment of fledgling engineers. But obviously computer science is very lucrative right now, so more importantly - yay, jobs for everyone!\u00a0\nHowever I\u2019m really not convinced that Damore appreciates or even understands the obstacles facing women in going into tech. For whatever reason, people who argue about current social movements in the public discourse seem to provide very scanty verbiage dressing over their honest beliefs which tend towards being considerably more dickish and fringe, which then taints any complex argument they might be trying to make. So there are basically no reasonable public observers without an agenda, from my perspective.\nThe writing is simple but it has heart. I enjoy learning about how she lived, about her private sorrows and what drives her. She\u2019s no Erma Bombeck, and although she quite often returns to the point of class distinctions and racial castes in America she\u2019s no Michelle Alexander either. \u00a0It\u2019s very personal though, and I think it tries to be honest, which I appreciate.\nFlanagan had these great quotes from Erma Bombeck\u2019s reaction (remember her?!) to meeting Betty Friedan for the first time. I love seeing when different people whose work I\u2019ve read collide into each other\u2019s worlds."}, {"blog_name": "stoner-joxter", "id": 175645959994, "date": "2018-07-07 17:09:57 GMT", "timestamp": 1530983397, "tags": ["discourse", "hnghh"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZMiw7f2ZbKASw", "note_count": 0, "body": "i liked a post and the most beautiful flower crown keith ive ever seen popped up as a recommended post but op was a shalashit this is so sad alexa play despacito"}, {"blog_name": "eebies", "id": 648120293791006720, "date": "2021-04-10 23:01:18 GMT", "timestamp": 1618095678, "tags": ["general", "/srs", "discourse", "// neg"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZRPp7ZZ_bVah8e00", "note_count": 132, "body": "on the topic of cishets:\nplease dni, \nplease\nif you wanna know why you're not welcome here, under the cut\nfirst, we are a \nqueer truthing community\nwe truth because we see ourselves and our experiences and journeys in the boys and its a type of relation experience. for cishet people, especially cishet girls, you are not truthing/shipping because you see yourselves in them, youre doing it because its two men in a relationship together and nothing else. i cannot think of a reason that a cishet girl, even a cishet boy, would be here outside of fetishizing mlm relationships.\nyoure not welcome, im sorry. its the \none\n thing i will gatekeep."}, {"blog_name": "ofgoldengardens", "id": 179055971384, "date": "2018-10-14 21:17:23 GMT", "timestamp": 1539551843, "tags": ["babies", "so many people are babies", "discourse", "bonus", "what you want to retcon or delete off your blog is always only your own business"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZFxg7b2cmaKmu", "note_count": 1, "body": "PSA You could reblog every single aesthetic post I reblog and/or share a passing resemblance to my character and I would probably only like them/you more for it lmfao"}, {"blog_name": "sarahsyna", "id": 168197049316, "date": "2017-12-04 21:46:59 GMT", "timestamp": 1512424019, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZZ9aSr2SfKqla", "note_count": 115, "body": "New source of anxiety: trying to figure out if the Fresh New Discourse is gonna be shitting on nb folks or shitting on pan folks, and knowing either way that we all lose thanks to exclusionists being bigoted trash."}, {"blog_name": "toastwiki", "id": 156797775658, "date": "2017-02-04 13:11:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1486213875, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPQC_s2I1u2yg", "note_count": 1, "body": "\u201cI LOVE YOU PLEASE BUY ME THINGS YOURE SO NICE EVEN IF I DONT KNOW YOU I LOVE YOU BUY ME SOMEYHIMG AND ILL NEVER TALK TO YOU AGAJN\u201d who do I sound like lmao"}, {"blog_name": "eorzean-capitalist", "id": 176078752949, "date": "2018-07-20 04:30:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1532061058, "tags": ["abusive people", "thelegendofkungjew", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZsVOmv2Z-78or", "note_count": 17, "body": "The problem Oz has, is they think they\u2019re intelligent.\u00a0 Smarter than your average bear.\u00a0 And they get mighty pissed when they can\u2019t just talk their way out of something because there\u2019s people who are even more intelligent and articulate holding their feet to the fire.\nSo they resort to deflections.\u00a0\u00a0\nMy accusers are the real abusive ones!\u00a0\n\u2018People keep picking apart my words and taking them at face value instead of getting my \nreal meaning\n!\nYou\u2019re making it hard for people to come to me because you make the environment unsafe for them!\nI\u2019m the real victim here because of xyz!\nSure, Jan.

Abuse counselors call this tactic defining reality.\nNo one owes you anything, and your victims fear you because YOU made it unsafe for them, not others.\nThe abusive man\u2019s high entitlement leads him to have unfair and unreasonable expectations, so that the relationship revolves around his demands. His attitude is: \u201cYou owe me.\u201d For each ounce he gives, he wants a pound in return.\nYou are not a victim.\u00a0 You try so hard to be one, but you aren\u2019t.\u00a0 End of story.\nHe may describe other wounds he received from a previous partner: She tried to control him; she wouldn\u2019t let him have any freedom; she expected him to wait on her hand and foot; she turned their children against him; she even \u201chad him arrested\u201d out of vindictiveness. What he is describing usually are his own behaviors, but he attributes them to the woman so that he is the victim. He can gain sympathy from his new partner in this fashion, especially because so many women know what it is like to be abused\u2014unfortunately\u2014so they can connect with his distress.\nBancroft, Lundy.

Definitely not Parker, who was more or less raised by her thief mentor and was never even \nin\n high school, and has noticeable difficulty interacting with people as an adult when we first meet her in season one. Not anyone who found as much time to learn how to code as Hardison did. Not Eliot either \u2014 it\u2019s \ncanon\n both that he took home ec and that he got teased by other guys for it. \nThere\u2019s a tendency to associate being good with the ladies with being gender-conforming (in men.) But you know what? When we see Eliot seducing women, he doesn\u2019t put on a strong manly man vibe. Mostly he goes for sensitive and attentive and \nvulnerable\n and women love it. That\u2019s not gender conforming. That\u2019s...not \nintrinsically\n incompatible with football captain, but they don\u2019t fit easily with each other either. \nEven the one time his physical fighting skill is a factor, with the other fighter (Mikel Dayan), it\u2019s less about his strength and more about mutual respect for each others\u2019 \nskill\n. The attraction is about both of them being really into the same thing, a thing that most people don\u2019t get that deeply into. \nAll of them are \u201cnerds\u201d in the sense of having a narrow range of interests that they get really, really into: Harrison\u2019s nerdery is focused on computers, which is classic, but Eliot\u2019s hard-skills nerdery that\u2019s focused on fighting and cooking and paying incredible amounts of attention to sensory details, is actually the same sort of thing just with a different focus.\nParker\u2019s is actually the most extreme: her interests at the start of the show are security systems and jumping off buildings and not much else, and she\u2019s also the least good at \u201cmasking\u201d or faking being normal. She asks what an ornamental houseplant is for, because at that point she really just doesn\u2019t see the value in anything outside of her very narrow interests. She doesn\u2019t even appreciate art as art, just as something that can be stolen. \nAnd I\u2019m not saying that to dis any of the characters. Rather? I\u2019m thinking: these are my kind of people, people who get really into things most people don\u2019t care about, and who tend to not get interested in things just because everyone else is. The sorts of people who don\u2019t know how to answer when other people ask them what music they like to listen to. (Well, maybe Eliot does.) The sorts of people who barely know what football \nis, \nbecause either a thing is your entire world or you know virtually nothing about it and care even less, with no middle ground. \nAnd they get to have an entire show about them doing amazing things and doing good in the world, you know? Their differences don\u2019t make them lesser. Parker doesn\u2019t \nhave\n to be able to appreciate art or know what plants are for! Being able to thwart complex security systems and jump off tall buildings is actually enough for her to be living an amazing life and contributing to the world in a positive way.\nAnd that means when Parker does start broadening her horizons, she\u2019s able to do it \nfor herself, \nbecause she decided she\u2019s missing out on things, and not to \u201cbe normal\u201d or fit in. Or because she has to do it to find people who care about her and support her, she was able to get that \nbefore\n making any changes. That\u2019s such a powerful message, you know?\nAnd when I see Eliot as captain of the football team high school AU headcanons, what I think is: that\u2019s missing Eliot\u2019s character, that\u2019s flattening him to \njust\n being good at things like fighting and sports and making him as stereotypically male as possible. Because just like Parker didn\u2019t need to be \nnormal\n or popular or even know how to make small talk with a jerk without sticking a fork in his hand in order to find \nher people\n, Eliot also didn\u2019t have to get on the football team to find \nhis\n people, and that matters too. He found his people by being himself, his weird oddball self who notices things other people miss and grows his hair out and is a fighter who won\u2019t touch guns and really notices people and is probably way too sensitive for his own good. Don\u2019t let his ability to terrify strangers by \nlooking\n at them and pound them flat when necessary keep you from seeing the rest of Eliot Spencer, the guy who never quite figured out how to be a \nnormal\n guy and decided early on that he wasn\u2019t going to bother trying. \nAnd that coexists peacefully and comfortably with Eliot as a guy who gets around a lot; I\u2019m polyamorous and kinky, and a lot of the guys in those worlds who get the most dates are absolutely not the sort of person who would have been captain of the football team in high school. Getting a lot of action \ndoes not \nsupport a narrative that Spencer is gender-conforming, even though getting a lot of action is something that manly men are supposed to aspire to. \nThere are a lot of people like that: who were loners, outcasts, bullied in school, and who later on were able to find people who didn\u2019t \ncare\n whether you made the cheerleading squad or whether you had the right kinds of celebrity crushes. Or the adult world equivalents. Who see value in people living their most authentic lives, rather than conforming as closely as possible to expected social roles. \nMaybe \nI\u2019m\n the one who\u2019s missing something, and this sort of hc is about how you can be all that \nand\n get the social recognition of being homecoming king or queen as well. Maybe it\u2019s coming from people who like to imagine that they could have had that without sacrificing parts of themselves. I for one am very firmly in the category of \u201cfuck them and their arbitrary markers of acceptability, I\u2019m going off and finding better goals to aspire to.\u201d\nParker \nwas not\n a cheerleader, even though she had all the physical abilities that being a good cheerleader requires (plus the looks for it.) Eliot \nwas not\n football captain. They got to do amazing things with their lives because\n being football captain or chearleading whatever is not actually especially important\n. It\u2019s just a marker of success within a very specific social context that\u2019s disconnected from being able to do anything in particular outside of that context, and which prioritizes conformity, especially conformity to gender roles, over authenticity and diversity.\n(Note, because apparently this is necessary: this is a personal opinion, people get to have whatever headcanons they want, don\u2019t harass people, etc. it\u2019s better to lift up examples of doing it well than be confrontational about people doing it badly. I just think it\u2019s actually more meaningful and more consistent with canon to present Eliot as an \noutsider\n in high school than to present him as one of the popular kids, and popular in an extremely conventional/stereotypical way at that.) \n(I can relate to the Eliot who got teased for taking home ec but felt secretly vindicated because he was the one getting close one on one attention from a hot lady teacher; I cannot possibly relate to football captain Eliot.)\n(It\u2019s a power thing? Within a high school social framework, football players and cheerleaders (not at my high school, but whatever) have the most social status and therefor the most power. The whole deal with the Leverage crew is that they\u2019re restoring power imbalances. Putting them in positions of relative power makes \nno sense\n. Highschooler Eliot should be beating up the football captain for groping the girls or bullying weaker boys, not \nbeing\n the football captain himself.)"}, {"blog_name": "disasterqueers", "id": 172608874130, "date": "2018-04-05 02:19:54 GMT", "timestamp": 1522894794, "tags": ["haydn", "discourse", "my fave line today is 'when will you realize hating other trans people wont make cis people like us more'", "a community divided stands no fucking chance", "lemme know if yall need this tagged as anything im just annoyed"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZrcKSa2WmIcQI", "note_count": 16, "body": "hhhhh btw trans guys that like flowers and\u00a0\u201c\u201dfeminine\u201d\u201d colors are still.... guys\nlike. 100% no doubts guys no matter how\u00a0\u201c\u201dsoft\u201d\u201d or\u00a0\u201c\u201dcute\u201d\u201d they are bc those words have 0 reflection on gender\nalso like... at this point\u00a0\u201ctranstrender\u201d shouldnt be a word tossed around in arguments. people are allowed to try and figure themselves out. people are allowed to figure out what makes them comfortable. people screaming about\u00a0\u201ctranstrenders\u201d and having pissing contests about dysphoria only threw me further in the closet bc i thought if i didnt have crippling disphoria literally 24/7 i wasnt trans and thats not how it is. its different for everyone, and how many stories will it take for everyone to calm down? we all experience it differently, we all felt differently, we\u2019re all sensitive to different things. its NOT a uniform experience and treating it like it is just hurts our community"}, {"blog_name": "crimsonlikeblood", "id": 655193976615452672, "date": "2021-06-28 00:54:27 GMT", "timestamp": 1624841667, "tags": ["discourse", "mcyttwt", "mcyt twitter", "negativity", "twitter", "mcyt", "hannahxxrose", "boomerna", "snifferish"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZCu6EVaNjtDB8y00", "note_count": 115, "body": "I just think it's hilarious how many people on mcyttwt think Mcytblr is worse than them when they're the ones freaking out about everything and we're sitting here marvelling at how stupid mcyttwt is."}, {"blog_name": "tangerine-55", "id": 653000433570381824, "date": "2021-06-03 19:49:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1622749742, "tags": ["dreamwastaken", "dream mcyt", "mcyt", "dream defense", "discourse", "pride merch", "dream merch", "i am SO MAD right now", "If he cancels the merch now I will cry", "you can never make people happy", "EVERYONE IS HAPPY FOR JUST ONE DOLLAR DONATION ITS BETTER THAN NO MONEY AT ALL"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZMZD_haFx6z18u00", "note_count": 91, "body": "I am so pissed\nDream deleted the tweet where he said he'd donate 10% of his revenue (!!!)

If you're not ace, why the hell are you arguing about ace people, without the experience of actually being ace? If you're arguing about what defines being trans or nb or queer or any sort of label you give yourself, you better actually have the experience of being said labels, or else, well. Why the fuck are you arguing about it in the first place? If it doesn't involve you, then there's no need to stick your nose where it doesn't belong.\nSecond, just fucking respect people, dammit. Unless the person has intentionally and unrepentantly hurt people, there really isn't any reason to go out of your way to attack or harrass them, and doxxing or other actual, literal threats are. Y'know. ILLEGAL. Going back to the first point, if this isn't a person that has actually, directly hurt you or someone you care about, there's no reason to hurt them. Granted, if they have hurt you, then go wild - but remember, (most of) the words behind a screen are actual people. If you harrass someone, you're not harrassing an ideology, you're hurting a person, and there's a difference there. The best way to fight an ideology you disagree with is with debates and arguments and evidence, and most importantly, respect. If you can find the time to harrass somebody, you can gather up the courage to actually talk to them and explain why you disagree, rather than using personal attacks that, by the way, will get you precisely nowhere. Just don't be an asshole, yeah?\nThird: form your own damn opinions. This hellsite has a nasty habit of twisting words and phrases and facts to the agendas of whoever holds the editing software, and it seems to me (I hope to fuck that I'm wrong, but knowing this site's users, I find myself doubting it) that a lot of people on this site simply believe read some random person's blog post and believe it to automatically be fact. Granted, we all do things like that sometimes - the problem is when one only believes said thing read on a random-ass blog post on a shittily-run site that is swarmed with porn bots and, apparently, Russian chaos agents. Don't make their jobs easier, guys. If there's a link, click on it and make sure it doesn't take you to randompagenerator.com or some other bullshit. Don't just trust what other people say and \"facts\" that somebody made up from their basement - look it up yourself. We all know how to use google, just find your own information and form your own opinion. Then, and only then, can you actually make a sound argument - otherwise, you're just a parrot, and nobody wants to be a parrot. I think. Who fuckin knows.\nSo yeah, that's my Hot Take of the night. It really shouldn't be news to people, but whatever. I'm tired of discourse with no purpose that, while some of it could probably be solved by actually talking shit out, seems to degrade into blatant name-calling, not to mention. Y'know. Harrassment. People, Tumblr is not reality. If you find yourself arguing with someone by the name of daddy's-little-slut over whether or not trans people exist, you're in too deep. Go somewhere else. Talk to some friends. The block and unfollow buttons are there to be used.

As people who easily dismissed the other side for their apparent lack of \u201ccommon sense,\u201d and could therefore discredit their provision of sources and medical backup arguments because \u201cof course you\u2019ll provide shit from people as down the rabbit hole as you are! People like you believe anything!!\u201d They would justify their hatred of us by painting us a threats as well, claiming we only exist as we a re to be predators. They were entirely certain that their side was the only credible, sensible way to understand and view things. \n\n\nWhat they really were, of course, were ignorant fools who failed to grasp even basic concepts of gender in relation to sex, biology, and were in complete denial of the existence of intersex people. They felt like they were in a position to ridicule other people because they thought they knew better, when in reality they knew next to nothing about the very people they were targeting, and would never listen to a word from one of us. They insisted they were the victims of trans people tricking or preying on them, without ever acknowledging the oppression they hold over us.\n\n\nSo why is it, that when confronted with my supposed LGBT \u201callies,\u201d I\u2019m supposed to believe all these non asexual people insisting they know better about it. Screaming that they\u2019re right in their stances, and demanding that their mockery and bullying be recognized as justified because they believe themselves to be correct?\n\n\nBecause the entirety of what I have seen is non asexual people presenting false definitions and understandings of asexuality to support their arguments (see the its just a modifier, its just not wanting to have sex, its not a coherent orientation, its not a real thing, its a medical problem, its just too much information, its equivalent to heterosexual arguments.)\n\n\nWhat I\u2019ve seen is people claiming that they know better about what asexuals face, despite not being asexual (see asexuals don\u2019t face any discrimination, aces aren\u2019t oppressed, aces don\u2019t face targeted prejudice, all aces suffer from racism, sexism, and ableism only and those things cannot intersect with asexuality, aces face no medicalization, no increased threat of rape, only ever have to deal with somewhat mean jokes arguments.) without ever listening to and acknowledging ace testimonies and voices saying the opposite.\n\n\nAll I see are people clinging to their supposed historical facts, without even looking at or addressing the recorded history and lived experiences of older community members that prove quite the opposite (see the erasure of the spinster movement, the existence of recorded asexual people and terminology, the once accepted definition of bisexuality that included aces, the insistence that the whole community came together for a singular cause, the community never stood to protect anyone but \u201cSGA\u201d and trans people, the queer is a slur and not an acceptable reclaimed umbrella term, and aces were never considered queer arguments.)\n\n\nAll I see are people who are on a smear campaign to paint the entire asexual community as evil, homophobic, and disgusting to justify their hatred of them and refusal to listen (see the asexuality is inherently homophobic, the split attraction model and anyone who uses it is homophobic, teaching asexuality in schools is homophobic, the whole ace community is white and cishet, the whole community is responsible for the actions of a few, the whole community is guilty for letting bad asexuals exist, the whole community is proven disgusting by offensive screenshots of one ace, the whole community hates only gay PDA, the whole community wants to ban sexuality from lgbt spaces at all, the whole community condones and encourages the behavior of the bad ones, the whole community pushed its way in and wants to steal attention from others and talk over them, and the whole community was created by a racist homophobe arguments.)\n\n\nAll I see are people who replicate the exact behavior of every gross, anti inclusionary arguing, bullying, ignorant, hateful behavior and tactics of every other group that has been wrong, and they want me to believe that they are somehow right this time around."}, {"blog_name": "froqqy", "id": 161506729129, "date": "2017-06-06 14:21:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1496758903, "tags": ["discourse", "i guess", "yall are so intent on making sure nobody forgets the aces but when lesbians are mentioned??", "WHOM??", "nerd speaks"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZRVzHl2MQZHof", "note_count": 16, "body": "STOP EXCLUDING THE LESBIAN FLAG IN YA FUCKIN PRIDE POSTS!!!

We were discussing whether gender is socially constructed \u2014 I was saying it was, and that people have innate feelings of gender which they try to fit into or match up to their cultures\u2019 constructions of gender. She was saying that while the shape of the container changes, the container itself doesn\u2019t. She\u2019d be a woman no matter what culture she was raised in.\nAs an example, we discussed the differences in the way Jewish culture and Western goyish culture construct gender, with me lowkey implying that on some levels they\u2019re different genders, since they\u2019re different gender constructions. She was saying that while a Jewish woman and a Christian woman may express their gender differently, they\u2019re still both women. On the other hand, I feel drawn to Jewish masculinity as a space to inhabit and not at all to Western goyish masculinity.\nAnd I was thinking about how this discussion could have gone, were we operating within some of the patterns of discourse I\u2019ve seen here. Maybe, were I operating in that context, I would\u2019ve started calling her a nasty binarist who hates nonbinary people and is probably a truscum. And maybe she\u2019d have started calling me a transmisogynist who hates binary trans people and was invalidating her identity as a woman. And then maybe if it were really bad it would\u2019ve escalated, maybe we\u2019d have sent anon hate, sent our followers after each other, cancelled each other, written callouts, etc.\nInstead, we both reflected on each other\u2019s differing frameworks and learned more about  each other\u2019s experiences and deepened our own working understandings of gender. And we\u2019re still friends!\nI think there are a lot of factors that made the interaction what it was \u2014 our existing friendship, the format (her facebook profile), our mutual trust, the fact that she\u2019s not in toxic discourse spaces and I\u2019ve largely removed myself from ones I\u2019ve been in, work I\u2019ve done on my trauma that leads to less reactivity (the conversation didn\u2019t make me reactive at all actually, but I see how it could have felt invalidating to someone and brought that up for them).\nI think we all have a lot to think about regarding trauma, reactivity, and the tendency to jump from \u201cI disagree with this person\u201d to \u201cdisagreement is invalidating\u201d to \u201cthis is harmful\u201d to \u201cpeople need to be protected from this person\u201d to lashing out, callout posts, fighting, etc.\nIt\u2019s okay to have different frameworks than other people, and it doesn\u2019t have to mean you\u2019re on different sides of a war or that their framework invalidates yours or that their framework is inherently oppressive. It doesn\u2019t have to mean danger. It\u2019s also okay if you\u2019re not there yet and a lot of reactivity does come up for you when these disagreements happen.

(I didn\u2019t want to hijack their post so I made my own, but you should definitely read theirs because wow what great meta).\nYes. I totally agree with everything. (Get it? \nTotal\n?) Yeah. Total never really became a likable character for me, at least partially because he never developed further than\u00a0\u201ccomic relief\u201d (and it wasn\u2019t even great comic relief?)\nBut imagine if he were set up as a foil for Jeb. (And not just in the sense that Total is a human in an animal\u2019s body and Jeb is an animal in a human\u2019s body). Total was the first living character invited to join the Flock after Jeb left them.\nImagine a Total that is fiercely protective of the Flock. That wakes them up at night when there\u2019s danger. That helps them find food. That uses his amazing animal capabilities to predict panic or anxiety attacks and helps them through it. He wouldn\u2019t even have to talk; just be loyal, patient, and loving in a way the Flock never received from anybody or anything else.\nThat would be in direct conflict with Jeb\u2019s character. Jeb was the adult who broke their trust and betrayed them for his own interests. While Jeb helped the Flock survive, Total could be the one who helped them live. And while the Flock was dependent on Jeb to a degree, in this case Total was dependent on them, but he returned the favor. Jeb had an agenda behind everything; this Total would be acting from good will. Jeb tried to keep them sheltered from the world; Total wanted them to get\u00a0\u201ccultured.\u201d\nI think it would be a reasonable way to help the Flock learn to trust again and fit into society.\n(and if you want to keep with the genre and the talking, have Total do stuff only a tiny dog could do, like fit in air vents, or spy on unsuspecting shoppers, or \nsomething\n\u00a0that doesn\u2019t just make him the hoity-toity friend, please)"}, {"blog_name": "queerasaurus-rexx", "id": 672824876281856000, "date": "2022-01-08 15:30:03 GMT", "timestamp": 1641655803, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZqJTSnbMMga2qu00", "note_count": 0, "body": "why is it so goddamn hard for the internet to say it agrees with someone whose opinion on something else is disagreeable?\nlike, some people just come from a position of bad takes and a refusal to learn, but some people have varied and nuanced opinions on a variety of topics.\nyou can say you agree with someone's opinion on bigotry while disagreeing with their position on climate change, on population growth, on abortion. you agreeing with someone on one thing does not change the fact that you also disagree with them on something else. \npolitics isn't a hivemind."}, {"blog_name": "sharp-maws-and-sweet-draws", "id": 181123323142, "date": "2018-12-15 01:16:24 GMT", "timestamp": 1544836584, "tags": ["vampire", "discourse", "rude"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z8RErX2ehofK6", "note_count": 5, "body": "I hope y'all realize that putting \"Vampires don't interact\" on a post means we literally can't.

Initially,\nwhen I saw this blog crop up, I was intrigued because I've had personal\nencounters and seen proof of certain players on Balmung behaving poorly but\nhave enough clout to get away with being reprehensible assholes. Full\ndisclosure, I was even considering submitting some receipts to this blog as\nproof of how they were misinformed about a situation they were rallying against\n(off anon\n*\n, and I have receipts for that convo, too) but I decided against it\nfor a few reasons. Below I go into those reasons and why I think anyone submitting or viewing this site should be cautious.\n1. Balmung Blunders is \"Helping\" Balmung\nThis\nsounds like a good thing, right? There are some people that SHOULD be put on\nblast, but Balmung Blunders requires 0 evidence of people's claims and allows\nsubmissions for some petty shit. There is a marked difference between taking\nabusers to task and spreading complaints about why x person thinks y's RP is\nannoying. If the people or person at Balmung Blunders really cared about\nexposing abusers and pedophiles, there would be a higher standard of proof and\ninvestigation than just anonymous submissions. Sure, anon submissions are a\ngood place to start looking into a problem, but publishing without any\ninvestigation or proof leads to skewed information getting out there. Again, if\nBB was super interested in justice they wouldn't be focusing on God-modding and\n\"bad rp\" in the same breath as pedophiles. A pedophile isn't in the\nsame league as a special-snowflake by far, and BB's legitimacy is pretty much\nshot for pursing those on the same level. \n2. Balmung Blunders cannot be questioned\n\"If\nyou're angry at us, you're part of the problem,\" this statement alone\ndissuades any sort of valid criticism. A blog really concerned about protecting\nthe community should be open to hearing concerns instead of slapping the\nequivalent of \"lol ur mad\" on folks. BB seems to equate people\nquestioning how their blog is being operated as enablers of bad behaviour in\nthe community, or even predators themselves. A few people I've seen have tried\nto address this blog on anon and not gotten too far. On the part of BB it's the\neasiest course of action to assume that everyone that has a problem with them\nis just mad because they were called out or because they had a friend that was\ncalled out, that type of thinking means they don't have to be introspective\nabout what they're doing or the effects that spreading misinformation might\nhave on other people. Some people being called out in a legitimate way SHOULD\nbe angry and uncomfortable, but when a predator is being lumped in with people\nthat just throw tantrums AND without proof, it's going to be super easy for\nthat predator to handwave and say \"well everyone knows that blog is just\nabout gossip\".\n3. Balmung Blunders is Anonymous\nThis one partly relates to the point above. It\u2019s glaringly obvious. Stand by your convictions.\nThe person or people running BB aren't transparent about who they are because\nthey don't want to become a target themselves, but if they really believe that\nwhat they're doing is right and necessary, any blowback would be worth it in\nthe interest of legitimately helping someone. People aren't going to trust a\ngrey face running this blog, because they aren't going to trust that this\nperson (or people) don't have their own agenda and bias. Hiding behind\nanonymity allows BB to control the narrative however they want, without truly\nbeing questioned or held accountable for any errors they make. Remaining\nanonymous is a convenient way to continue to do sloppy work and not be\naccountable for people hurt by it. Abusers can also take advantage of that anonymity: \u201cOh, that blog is just posting that because it\u2019s probably so-and-so that has a grudge on me.\u201d BB also demonstrates a double standard: anyone criticizing them on anon is hiding something, but the people submitting anonymous tips about others are somehow trustworthy enough to be produced on their blog.\u00a0\n\u00a0In closing:\nBB\nallegedly wants to rout the bad from Balmung. They might even believe that\nclaim. If BB is patting themselves on the back thinking they are actually\nhelping and revelling in the stir they're causing, I'd really suggest taking a\ncloser look at what you are trying to do and how you go about doing it. People\nneed to be held accountable for their actions here, sure, but how BB is trying to achieve that is just going to allow people getting away with bad shit to continue\ngetting away with bad shit. Some of the stuff people are being accused of on\nhere is serious, things that can and have really hurt people, but Balmung Blunders\nseems to completely lack insight about what \n\"helping\" really is.\n*for the record I have never submitted anything to Balmung Blunders on or off anon"}, {"blog_name": "tell-deathisaid-hello", "id": 666079229591568385, "date": "2021-10-26 04:30:53 GMT", "timestamp": 1635222653, "tags": ["what the fuck", "humans", "social troubleshooting", "I should have wrote this on the fucking post but I\u2019m a chicken", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZYLvzva_OuV04a01", "note_count": 0, "body": "It is amazing to me how someone can make a post about their own very specific feelings or experiences, and instead of feeling compassion for the obvious pain that person is in, someone will come along and write an essay about what an asshole that person is for writing something so offensive to someone else\u2019s way of thinking.

Discomfort, shame, and deeply unsettling self-evaluations may accompany such manipulation. Gaslighting is most commonly associated with intimate partner/domestic abuse, with the gaslighter using alienation, isolation, and projection to convince their significant other that their understanding of the relationship and by extension the world are totally wrong. The target of gaslighting is ridiculed, shamed, and sometimes even brutalized into affirming a worldview that mirrors their abuser\u2019s. But gaslighting is also larger than the individuals involved in a given interpersonal interaction; these interactions often mirror and invigorate wider forms of structural violence.\nDuring a recent graduate seminar at the University of Toronto, Michelle Murphy, a feminist historian of science, introduced the concept of \ngenealogies of gaslighting\n. These genealogies trace the foundational assumptions of the logic that seeks to legitimize the violence to which marginalized communities are subjected. Together they illuminate how modes of \nkyriarchal\n oppression produce ignorance, which is not simply an absence of knowledge, but also a refusal to know. In plainer terms, the \ngenealogies of gaslighting\n are the historical-sociological formations of overlapping systems of domination that assert a particular set of identities as normal, and then subsequently make those identities into material realities. White supremacy\u2019s utilization of scientific logics to construct categories of difference and hierarchies of superiority/inferiority that justify violence against Black and other racialized bodies is one facet of these genealogies. The use of biology to rigidly define \u201cnormal\u201d sex and gender within a binary regime that heavily regulates or altogether prevents gender non-conforming individuals from having agency over their gendered self-determination is another.\nWhite supremacy is a part of these genealogies of gaslighting, and white ignorance is one means by which supremacism sustains itself. In \u201c\nWhite Ignorance\n,\u201d Charles Mills describes how \u201cthe white delusion of racial superiority insulates itself against refutation\u201d and so refuses to affirm ways of knowing (and being) that do not share assumptions that reinforce marginality. White supremacy attempts to acculturate not only white people but people of all ethno-racial backgrounds into believing and upholding the social, political, and economic structures that comprise it. It seeks to maintain its own infallibility.\n\u201cShow me evidence that racism still exists,\u201d may be one demand to which Black people are subjected, as though centuries of abolitionist writings, personal accounts of violence, policy documents and Department of Justice investigations, the unending video stream of Black lives lost to police murder, and 19th century lynching postcards\u2014still circulating\u2014are insufficient. Supremacism-contradicting knowledge is, through manipulation, rendered less credible. This forces people producing anti-racist knowledge to carry a never-ceasing burden of responsibility to \u201cprove\u201d themselves.\nDominant knowledge\u2014the facts and truths asserted and defended by systems of power\u2014is a social construction (as opposed to unarguable fact) that dismisses, redefines, co-opts or altogether erases contradictory knowledges. It is within this context of knowledge and ignorance production that, for example, whitewashing and cultural appropriation exist. Because whiteness demands control over defining non-whiteness, cultural productions circulate at the expense of the peoples to whom they belong.\nDonald Trump\u2019s deployment of \u201cfake news\u201d\u2014an approach that combines his habitual lying, a refusal to be held accountable for his statements, and a blatantly anti-Semitic skepticism of the media\u2014presents a clear example of gaslighting in action. But Trump\u2019s use of false rhetoric has been well-covered. More subtle yet nevertheless insidious is the gaslighting performed by Rachel Dolezal and those who, in the name of \u201creal intellectual curiosity,\u201d defend her claims (and others who defend those defenses) to \u201ctransracialism.\u201d\nDolezal has, for the most part, been handled carefully by cis white America, treated more like an amusing oddity than the embodiment of harm. The assumption that she is \u201cmerely\u201d guilty of cultural appropriation necessarily obscures the white entitlement inherent to painting on Black skin and taking on another racialized identity as one\u2019s own. This is likely because her entire schtick is predicated on white America\u2019s deep disdain for two groups of people: Black women and trans people.\nDolezal\u2019s claim to Blackness is rooted in the misogynoiristic tradition of reducing Black womanhood to a costume or commodity\u2014something that can be put on and removed at will. Dolezal can adopt and abandon \u201cblackening\u201d aesthetics like bronzer and twist-out wigs as she wishes because her so-called affinity for blackness, though supposedly deep, is rooted in an understanding of Black womanhood as a \u201c\nculture, a philosophy, a political and social view\n,\u201d or, in other words, something that can be extracted from history and brought into the realm of choice and self-identification. And it is important to note that Dolezal altogether waived her Blackness when she chose to \nsue Howard University\n in 2002 for discriminating against her because she was white. This is not unlike the actions of Abigail Fisher, who, in the ultimate fragile expression of white entitlement, sued the University of Texas for reverse discrimination, thereby potentially jeopardizing affirmative action when she simply failed to meet the academic requirements for admission.\nThese are the identity politics that Rebecca Tuvel reinforces in her analogy-defense of transracialism and \u201ctransgenderism\u201d published in the leading feminist philosophy journal, \nHypatia\n, at the end of March. In an article titled \u201cIn Defense of Transracialism,\u201d Tuvel seeks to analogize changing race to changing gender: if we validate trans people\u2019s transitions, we must necessarily also validate Rachel Dolezal\u2019s. Even though she acknowledges that \u201cDolezal may have been driven by ulterior motives that inclined her to pretend to be Black\u201d and feigns a neutrality by stating it is not her responsibility to \u201cdecide the Dolezal case one way or the other,\u201d she weighs in nonetheless and validates Dolezal\u2019s identity by placing her in the same realm as trans people. There have been a number of pointed critiques, including those by noted transfeminist Julia Serano, but the great part of the public conversation has been defensive of Tuvel, revolving around left and right convergences of \u201cacademic freedom\u201d or decrying the harms of \u201ccallout culture\u201d in academia, while notably omitting engagement of the counter-arguments posed.\nDolezal\u2019s claim to Blackness also relies upon transmisogyny and a gross misappropriation of narratives around the social construction and fluidity of identity\u2014physical dysphoria, and \u201cwrong bodiedness\u201d\u2014that some trans people articulate in a number of different ways. From the beginning, her \u201ctrans-racial\u201d identity was a misappropriation of the identities of adoptees who used the word to describe the experiences of being adopted into families with different ethno-racial identities than their own.. As she has seized the opportunities afforded to her to explain herself (and promote her book), she has even more explicitly weaponized trans experiences to legitimize her own, going so far as to say in a \nrecent interview\n: \u201cThere\u2019s more stigma for race fluidity than gender fluidity right now, and I don\u2019t think anybody would deny that.\u201d\nDolezal would be bad enough if everyone simply ignored her. But because she deliberately evokes the white cis majority\u2019s contempt for and refusal of both trans and black self-determination, her claim to Blackness is treated as an opportunity to explore the boundaries of identity rather than as sheer racist opportunism. Though earnest interrogations of these boundaries have been made by Black trans scholars like Kai M. Green, outright defenses of transracial claims that fail to draw upon Black or trans scholarship at length, like that of Tuvel, are disingenuous.\nDominant cisnormative logic dismisses trans personhoods as altogether illegitimate by denying the reality of trans people\u2019s needs, experiences, and self-understanding. With Dolezal, the \u201cunseriousness\u201d of trans identities juxtaposed against their \npotential\n for realness: being trans is entertained as some potential identity within the realm of some gendered possibility, but it exists as a source of comparison and analogy rather than a state of being that is unequivocally affirmed and respected by us as cisgender people. Gender non-conformity becomes part of a series of hypothetical constructions as opposed to a diversity of narratives and material identities that exist without question, and when the transgender-transracial analogy is employed, these experiences become ripe for the callous co-opting and exploiting.\nDolezalean-style gaslighting rests upon three layers of white supremacist logic. First is the presumption of the perpetual victimization of white womanhood; in positioning her desires to be Black and beautiful in proximity to the parental abuses she says she has experienced, she accesses a sympathetic victim role (one that potentially explains her behavior emerging from a place of childhood trauma) that is the sole domain of white women. Second, she capitalizes on a cultural moment of trans hypervisibility, constantly comparing herself to Caitlyn Jenner, who came out as a trans woman just a couple of months before Dolezal was outed as white. But if Dolezal truly seeks to share her navigation of the world as the finally free Black woman that was never allowed to be, why does she invoke Jenner, a white woman rather than her Black trans sisters who are \u201csimilarly\u201d forced to defend their transitions and identities? Lastly, Dolezal knows that because constructions of race are in many ways organized around anti-Blackness, the majority of white people would rather deride Black women than listen to our objections to her co-option of our identity. It isn\u2019t any surprise that defenders of Tuvel are using \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to describe Black and trans calls for accountability from both \nHypatia\n and Tuvel herself. And it is even less of a surprise that Tuvel\u2019s defenders are attacking critics of her article (myself included) as opposed to the well-founded academic rebuttals of her work. Many cis Black men, like clockwork, also opted to defend this white woman through claims that she has done more work for the community than most of us have. As Trudy of \nGradient Lair\n incisively noted:\n\u201cThis is very \nspecific\n to a White woman/Black woman dynamic. It is the same reason why Black men defend Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, and Lily Allen et. al. in ways they never defend White male cultural appropriators. So much appropriation and erasure of Black women is intraracially justified because of the hetero Black male gaze.\u201d\nIjeoma Oluo\u2019s recent \ninterview\n (and psychological profile) of Dolezal is the first interview that has clearly illuminated the depths of the raced-gendered delusion and entitlement within which she operates. In one of the most revealing parts of the interview, Oluo questions Dolezal about the chapter of the book where she compares herself to enslaved Africans. Dolezal distinguishes her comparison from the wrongful analogies of other white people by saying that \u201cthose people are not aware, they haven\u2019t been black history professors.\u201d Dolezal, it\u2019s worth noting, is a former Black history professor with degrees in art\u2014not any kind of African or Afro-diasporan history. Nevertheless, she commandeers authority all the same. As the interview progresses, Dolezal increasingly responds to Oluo with the characteristic agitation and dismissiveness of a white woman exasperated with a Black woman on the verge of revealing a grand ruse. Fortunately for Dolezal, nobody listens to Black women\u2014we are not the authorities on Black womanhood. She knows this. Dolezal\u2019s entire being relies on this.\nGaslighting makes us question ourselves because we are forced to entertain how white supremacy voids us of our humanity and our capacity to define ourselves as equals. Because, for instance, Tuvel\u2019s article will be seen as an authoritative disciplinary engagement on race and gender, it will likely be added to academic curricula and reading lists and perhaps eventually even become canonical (though still controversial) in gender studies.\nBoth Dolezal and Tuvel demonstrate the infallibility and virtuosity of cis white womanhood: despite the harm they enact, they are still always worthy of understanding, protection, kid-gloves. Assumptions about the \u201cfakeness\u201d or subordinate status of trans and Black identities ground Dolezal\u2019s (and white supremacy\u2019s) ability to co-opt and pit the experiences of marginalized people against one another. Because of how our navigations of the world are dismissed, we are shamefully forced to make ourselves legible to a gaze that can only ever see us as less than. Attempting to dispel these harmful ideas in academic discourses, we are often forced to wade through the trenches of normalized and canonical bigotries via literature review. If we choose to engage in this one-sided dialogue with power, we sometimes self-police so as not to be too threatening, or we center and accommodate the feelings of our oppressors so that our humanity becomes easier for them to understand. We are often forced to abandon our justifiably militant positions in favor of more respectable ones or silence simply because a means of coping can become a priority over never-ending and seemingly hopeless demands for our rights to humanity and freedom from violence.\nIt is not enough to simply hope that Dolezal, or any other career appropriator, simply disappears. As long as there is a structural and systemic investment in discrediting gender non-conforming and Black identities and subordinating the understandings they possess, these gaslighting genealogies that define and regulate humanity will continue, and the Dolezals of the world (and their defenders, and their defenders\u2019 defenders) will spawn and flourish like the cockroaches they are."}, {"blog_name": "clubpenguinkiller", "id": 158737469103, "date": "2017-03-23 11:39:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1490269181, "tags": ["su", "discourse", "text post", "rin rambles"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z055Ey2JrVOwl", "note_count": 2, "body": "honestly bismuth was really cool  i hated her design at first but then it made sense coz she s a blacksmith and i hate the way the fandom treats her like?

If ALL the people who tout for the end of abortion, INCLUDING in teenagers and high risk pregnancies put their effort towards the babies, children, and teenagers who through the strict laws on abortion grew up unwanted abused or ended up murdered or committed suicide, and abolished the stigma around pregnancy and gave fathers a fighting chance to take care of their children unassisted with sole custody, abortion would not be a problem anymore because there would be almost no need for it. \nIf all of them put their money into research and fundraisers for these children and not into religion supported and funded affairs (which mostly means terrifying children outside their schools and horrifying mothers going to the doctor) then it would all be fine. Because teens and unwilling parents would know that their baby could go to a loving home instead of a rough callous world where they get shipped from place to place with two changes of clothes and one personal item in a GARBAGE BAG with no real guarantee of finding happiness or a childhood. \nPeople can continue to say \u201cno more abortion\u201d and ignore the culture that surrounds the practice and why it\u2019s objectively necessary, but it is so very unfair to turn a blind eye as soon as the baby is born. \nJust as someone who has seen first hand how the system works.

Because real, actual discourse is exploring the main basis of an opinion, trying to fully flesh out an argument and then coming out of such a discussion with a better understanding of your own principles because you have also seen what a beautiful perspective the other side can have. This is when you know that both people have valid opinions that have been reflected upon and analyzed. This is when the richness and diversity of our beliefs helps us expand our perspective and our world. This is a real\u00a0\u201clet\u2019s agree to disagree\u201d. This is arrived at by the practice of learning to ask the right questions. This is arrived at by respect and actually listening to the point that someone is making, and trying to understand it rather than attack it immediately. You cannot critique the weaknesses of a viewpoint without first understanding it in its best form.\nThe second, however, is lazy as fuck. It\u2019s a way of making sure that you aren\u2019t accountable for your own thoughts. It\u2019s a shutdown of discourse and critique and god damn it, it\u2019s just you being cowardly to face the fact that there might be something wrong with what you believe in. There is no such thing as a wrong opinion, but there is such a thing as an unfounded opinion. There is such a thing as an opinion based on faulty premises. There is such thing as an under-analysed opinion that was just adopted from god knows what source. And it is a great thing to be in the presence of people who can actually bring you up to question your opinion so that it can come out stronger.\nI dunno. I\u2019m tired of having discussions with some people who just...refuse to question themselves? Who refuse to adapt? I dunno. I just hate this culture of laziness when it comes to discussing ideas. Or some sort of general prideful attitude of refusing to expand a worldview.\nIt\u2019s scary to realize you\u2019re never actually sure of anything, fine. But they\u2019re called beliefs precisely because we\u2019ll never actually know. It\u2019s a risk.

Homosexuality is being exploited.\nFans contribute a great deal to that too. The fetishisation of male homosexual relationships has been a problem in fandom for years, especially of the characters that break away from toxic masculine traits and stereotypical masculinity. What happened with Sam and Bucky is just another example of this.\nTenderness between male characters has become synonymous with gayness and then fans feel hard done by when their perceived \"gayness\" isn't proven.

When I say \"In Ukraine the age of consent is 16 and I agree with that\" I am NOT saying \"you're an adult and you know what you're doing at 16\". I'm saying that, in eastern Europe, a child at 16 is at a comparable level of maturity to an 18yo one in western cultures. Some people don't know shit at 18, others actually have some of their shit together. It varies. People are people, and are different. There are cultural aspects of eastern Europe that require children to take on roles and responsibilities suited to adults earlier and with more tangible consequences. We trust people less from the get go. We are harder to take advantage of (not impossible or even rare, just harder). We grow up faster. I understand that this is hard to wrap your head around if you grew up in monocultural surroundings, or if the cultures you're familiar with don't have this maturity shift. That's just what I personally noticed with Ukraine and Canada. At 16 people at large are as mature there as 18yo are here. Age of consent is highly subjective and in a perfect world would be determined by an unbiased source on case to case basis.

Why? I don\u2019t understand the mental gymnastics the Nancy haters go through to conclude that Nancy just flat out lied to Steve while dating him for a year only to drop him because he didn\u2019t react to Barb\u2019s parents selling their house (going into debt to find someone she knows is dead) the way she wanted. Really? That\u2019s your logic? \nWhat do you think she did after they defeated the demogorgon in s1? Was like, oh I think I like Jonathan, but let me just keep dating Steve because he feels bad for slut shaming me? She went on to date Steve for a year because\u2026 because what? She felt sorry for Steve? After he slut shamed her? So she dated him? For\n nearly a year\n? \nJust because Nancy had feelings for Jonathan (that neither of them spoke to each other about) doesn\u2019t mean she \nlied to Steve for a year\n. She\u2019s a 16 to 17 year old depicted realistically, reacting \nrealistically \nto confusing emotions and guilt and trauma. She\u2019s not being manipulative. She\u2019s not deciding, oh I\u2019m going to stay with Steve for the sex. Is that what the Nancy haters think? That she was just like, oh Jonathan doesn\u2019t want to date me so I\u2019ll keep dating Steve for the sex? Seriously. You think a 16 year old girl who\u2019s just lost her best friend is going to do that? She\u2019s \nsixteen\n. She doesn\u2019t know herself well enough to even know what sort of feelings she has for Steve \nor\n Jonathan. She chose Steve because she knew she loved him and he loved her, \nas much as a 16 and 17 year can understand love, especially after they\u2019ve been through a trauma together\n. Stop treating her like a manipulative abusive \nadult\n! That\u2019s not what she is!\nThat so many want to color her as this manipulative liar and/or emotionally abusive is sickening to me. If you knew a 16 year old in real life who lost a friend and decided to keep dating a guy who \nhad just slut shamed her,\n who she had every reason to dump right after that humiliation, but didn\u2019t, why would you think she was \npretending to love him?\u00a0\nFor a year? \nAn entire year? \nFuck your messed up logic, Nancy haters. Fuck your demonization of a teenage girl. Fuck you for not allowing a teenage girl to have confused emotions and make mistakes. Fuck you for coloring her as as emotionally abusive when there are real abusers out there who \npurposefully manipulate people\n, but no, you\u2019re going to attack a teenage girl for not being reasonable all the fucking time, for not being able to express or understand her emotions perfectly well, after she\u2019s gone through a huge loss.\u00a0\nIf Nancy\u2019s actions in season 2 remind you of someone who has abused you, that is not proof that she herself is an abuser. If Nancy was shown having a pattern of behavior that hurt Steve continuously over the course of weeks or months, we would be having a very different conversation. But that is \nnot \nthe case. It\u2019s wrong to twist a narrative to fit your idea of Nancy being an abuser when that narrative does not exist, just as it\u2019s wrong to say an abused character\u2019s cruel actions are justified because of their abuse (B*lly H*rgrove). Your reasoning behind thinking Nancy is abusive needs to be questioned, no matter how justified you think it is. Regardless of how the fandom has hated Steve in the past, been misogynistic toward Nancy in the past, before season 2, Nancy was not written as abusive toward Steve. They \nboth \nmade mistakes, and the \nwriting did not give them enough scenes or dialogue\n to fully communicate their feelings toward each other in season 2. Miscommunication after \na single instance\n\u00a0of misunderstanding and argument in a relationship does not an abuser make."}, {"blog_name": "orhraa-yusu", "id": 653030335390662656, "date": "2021-06-04 03:44:18 GMT", "timestamp": 1622778258, "tags": ["covid", "my post", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZZJhvWaG1w5GWy00", "note_count": 3, "body": "Being upset about people not taking covid vaccines isn\u2019t very progressive of you\nMy body my choice, right?"}, {"blog_name": "ahp-discourse", "id": 179580976201, "date": "2018-10-30 07:27:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1540884463, "tags": ["Ace Discourse", "Discourse", "Text"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z_GCra2dFt3n9", "note_count": 4, "body": "Exclusionist:  \n\u201cHOW CAN ACE PEOPLE HAVE SEX?

I'm going to explain why many of us older members of the butch/femme community find the futch joke so damn offensive. To do that, I need to start somewhere at the beginning, which goes back further than most of you realize. And it's not your fault that you don't know \u2013 it's a consequence of marginalization.\n\n\nButch and Femme most closely function as gender identities and originate in a time and age when how you presented yourself was what you were. The words themselves didn't yet exist, but snippets of writings here and there reveal a history of queer women subverting heteronormative gender roles to create just barely socially acceptable public relationships. Perhaps some of those \u201cmanly\u201d women were actually men, but again, there was little separation between b/f and trans identities as we define them today. The broad blurry line between butch and transman remains to this day, but I digress.\n\nFast forward a few centuries to the 1960's and 70's. As second wave feminism surges ahead, as trans issues receive wider exposure, a gestalt emerges in the queer community to challenge the gender binary paradigm imposed by western Europe and colonialism. Butch and Femme women were increasingly accused of reinforcing that binary in an obstinate refusal to acknowledge our subversion of heteronormativity. That's why it was a group of trans, bisexual and butch women who fought back at Stonewall \u2013 the most marginalized and left to fend for themselves. \n\nIn reality, butch and femme are far less about fashion than behavior \u2013 even though there are traditions there too, remnants of an age when visual coding was crucial for finding each other. Things like \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cstone\u201d refer to additional behavioral components, while dapper, dandy, leather, sporty, stud etc refer to particular fashions \u2013 some of which are tied to race. What it means to look masculine or feminine changes with the ages, but what we expect of men and women themselves hasn't changed that much, in centuries. \n\nButch takes masculine qualities and makes them feminine strengths, while actively combining them with more traditionally feminine behaviors. She (they is perfectly acceptable too) must be strong, stoic in the face of public challenge, but tender and supportive in ways never expected of men. \n Femme likewise takes feminine traits while combining them with masculine. Are you familiar with the popular concept of a sexually dominant femme? This is because, traditionally, while butch makes the overture, femme controls the direction. Though there is absolutely no requirement that the two identities pair of diametrically, or even with other members of the b/f community at all. \n\nThe fact is, a woman might be wearing jeans and ballcap yet ooze femme in her carriage and behavior, and another might sport long, elegant hair and make up, yet have more butch in her pinky finger than a mainstream lesbian in combat boots. It is impossible to determine if a woman is butch or femme purely by appearnces.\n\nYet radical feminisits gained more control by the 1980's, stomping hardest on the trans, bisexual and butch/femme communities, accusing all of being binary in a profound act of hypocrisy. For those communities were and still are the ones who most defy gender norms. Radfems instead idealized a gender-neutral image which has since influenced many common aspects of queer women's fashion to this day. They very loudly and repeatedly presented butch and femme as being more about appearance than behavior to invalidate the identities, accused us of simply aping straight men and women. \n\nButch became the butt of every joke until it was just shy of a slur. No one wanted to be one of those ugly, mannish, man-hating, penis-envy butch lesbians. And femme? It was claimed by gay men and drag queens \u2013 only some of which were actual transwomen. Femme became just another synonym for \u201clooks straight\u201d. Oh ha ha, isn't it so impossible to pick out a femme from a group of straight women. We all know that running gag.  (Hint: it's real easy when you know you're looking for behavior rather than appearance).\n\nBut once you reduce butch and femme to matter of fashion rather than identity, it becomes very easy to enforce a spectrum that does not truly exist within the butch/femme paradigm. The radfems took something that violated their preferred mainstream ideology of a non-binary spectrum and forced it to fit. But while butch and femme are commonly paired and each possesses a spectrum of its own, the middle-ground is simple heteronormativity. In reality, if a queer woman is not butch or femme in her behavior, then she is not part of that paradigm. She is part of the larger more general queer community, regardless if she prefer masculine or feminine fashion.\n\nThe word futch only makes sense if you assume that a) butch and femme are fashion statements that exist on an arbitrary binary spectrum with each on opposite ends and b) that most queer women participate in this system. Because I was watching all along, I know for a fact that the word originated as a joke...consciously or subconsciously rooted in marginalization and amockery that has become a casual tradition. Most of us understand that futch is meant to be a harmless joke, but us older members of the target community immediately recall every nasty joke and comment about butch. We see yet another unwitting jab at a marginalized identity.\n\nWe look at it and ask cynically, why go with such an obvious adulteration of butch? Why go with the ikea cabinet word when you might have chosen the positively punny \u201cfetch\u201d(ing)? It's not an accident that someone, somewhere, chose the more obvious dig. So, I know most of you bear absolutely no malice and certainly don't know this history \u2013 something hard to acquire if sources are driven to the fringes \u2013 but if you read all of this, then perhaps you'll be more aware of what you make light of when you treat identities as fashion statements."}, {"blog_name": "girlsndnature", "id": 164390082027, "date": "2017-08-20 03:02:04 GMT", "timestamp": 1503198124, "tags": ["discourse", "op", "I feel for this girl"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZNrO_e2P6QPNh", "note_count": 1, "body": "Today I befriended a child.

to which, for the people that said that dream 'has no compassion because he would have known better in the first place', your ableism is showing. these people don't encourage positive growth because they don't care about actually changing minds and changing lives - they want to win. they're the ones who don't have the compassion, the patience or the sympathy to help people become better and understand why they were wrong, and most importantly, move on from that so that real change can be made. \nit's glaringly obvious that people who say these things only know the dream smp or mcyt through dream's controversies and the shitshow that is mcyttwt, and they don't know the true depth of the creators involved who are a breath of fresh air in comparison to the types of individuals who used to sit at the top of the gaming categories. they're not perfect and they're always learning, especially since a lot of them are still so young, but especially in comparison to the types of people you typically see in gaming communities, the mcyt/dsmp community is the last of your worries. to be overly concerned about it seems performative, like i always say."}, {"blog_name": "sunflowergif", "id": 169216150414, "date": "2018-01-02 06:41:55 GMT", "timestamp": 1514875315, "tags": ["amy shut up", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0Efsv2Tc4OkE", "note_count": 1, "body": "i think the main issue of ace discourse is that it\u2019s very surface level. stereotypes and other forms of interpersonal incidents with lgbt+ people have a history and a system attached to them that connects them with the oppression of lgbt people (and the specifics are often unique to the group and can apply to anyone within the group) whereas things considered\u00a0\u201cace oppression\u201d either fail to encompass the entire community or exist outside of the community and therefore fail to have a solid history and system attached especially within the context of the society that it supposedly exists within"}, {"blog_name": "foreign-feelings", "id": 157598659639, "date": "2017-02-23 04:58:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1487825882, "tags": ["depression", "comments", "like can u not", "omg", "discourse", "my sister has no actual manners", "wtf", "insta", "ridiculous", "why is she like this", "so embarrassing"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZX-P1y2IndBGt", "note_count": 3, "body": "My cousin is struggling with depression\nAnd life and she has been open about it it in social media and she posted an image from the Simpsons of Lisa crying and said #mood #ouch with a tear drop emoji and 100% lit my unbearable fucking sister rolls up into the comments in her god damn nuclear family planned Barbie mobile living in a cul-de-sac vibe and legit says \"it's national margarita day, turn that frown upside down girlie!\" \n\nShut.

This thing exists for a reason... might as well take advantage of it. Also, this does get kind of spooky and spiritual so I guess for that reason it does actually make sense to put it here.\nI sat with myself for well about an hour, consulting with my...tuplas? Thoughtforms? I don\u2019t even know what to call them at this point, either way I have worked with them for most of my life to aid me in executive functioning and emotion regulation.\nAnyway, I basically reached the conclusion that although my whole life I have hated and dissociated from myself and effectively not KNOWN it at all I need to learn to embrace it way more. Because who is to say that your highest self, often your inner voice, is not, in fact, the divine--or a manifestation of it? Or vice versa?\nFurther discussion below the cut:\nWhen you\u2019ve been made to feel small your whole life, this gets messed up--you suppress your inner voice. Even resent it. This is because people have been telling you as long as you can remember that you\u2019re thinking too much, you\u2019re feeling too much. You are doing too much. You are, effectively, too much.\nThis pedantry is \nnot necessarily\n abuse. (I really don\u2019t want to get into this discussion actually--it hits close to home. If anyone wants to have #discourse about this please message me privately.) The way I see it, abuse can and does often wear this mask. But here, I\u2019m talking about compassionate people. People who mean well, people who know better...people who truly love you, even. Because they know of no other way of escaping suffering themselves. They have learned the art of disappearance, of suppressing. These people do not feel their emotions, or even bear witness to them. They just\u00a0\u201croll with the punches\u201d and learn to deal with it without any regard to anything higher than themselves and how the comfort of others factors into their own comfort levels. (They may be religious, or even devout, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about here so bear with me.)\nEveryone\n is selfish.\nBut to those like me who feel constant signs coming from themselves and/or the divine, this is a difficult truth to swallow. How can these people suppress my crying out against this very real suffering at the hands of other humans--unfairness, injustice, cruelty? At whom can I direct my emotions?\nThe natural solution for me historically, and I\u2019m sure for many others, has been to direct it right back at people. After all, if the world won\u2019t listen, why would the divine? When you lose touch (or fail to make contact altogether) with your inner divine voice, you lose touch with others on this plane of existence. These people around you are not \u201ctruly\u201d voiceless in your eyes. You tell yourself that they could use their voice if they knew how. But this is about as useful as if we were to take this literally. Everyone has their own struggle, their own suffering, and therefore their own unique sense of voicelessness.\nI read somewhere--it was a suggestions blog or something similar, paraphrasing something else I\u2019m sure--that in order to escape suffering collectively, we must first escape it individually. What this means to me is that we must be mindful of the suffering to start with, and then following from that be able to claim power over it by essentially eluding it. By just as much as fixating on our own suffering, we are perpetuating, even inflicting it onto others.\nBut how can we abandon suffering if we are constantly experiencing it? Or even just bearing witness to it? Furthermore, how can we abandon suffering if the divine \nitself \nseems to perpetuate it? How do you, then, honor the divine, when it seems to hold you in utter contempt? Even Christ is said to have cried out\u00a0\u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d (Matthew 27:46) as he suffered on the cross.\nThis is answered with yet another question (I swear I\u2019m not trying to be woo-woo and annoying, this is just how I write!): how do you honor others? Most will say, I treat them the way I want to be treated. Why? Because this shows a basic level of respect for other people. Okay, then, how do you honor yourself? Uh. It\u2019s a tricky question. So let\u2019s go down a different path for now: how do you honor the divine?\nFor me personally, I would say I partake in worship. I sing in church. I leave offerings...but I haven\u2019t been so hot about doing that lately. Hmm... I pray. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s actually honoring them though? Like, I ask for small, realistic things. I seek these blessings and therefore, they are found. I thank them. I feel grateful. Is that honoring them?\nI told myself, or the divine told me, or whatever, that YES, that IS honoring them, because you are doing what they would want you to do \nto honor yourself\n. You are honoring them by welcoming them into your life. Welcomes are not stay-forevers...they know that you can, and may, kick them out at some point, just like you would with just about anyone who you felt overstayed their visit. (Maybe you have done it before, and everyone knows it\u2019s probably going to happen again, and no-one is saying anything and it\u2019s really awkward!) But you should KNOW that as soon as YOU say the word they will honor you! and! they will honor \nthemselves\n! They will tell themselves, \u201cwe are free.\u201d They will not be there on your doorstep, nagging for re-entry. Nor will they be waiting at your threshold with fire and brimstone at the ready for your next f*ckup. (Whether you are at peace with what happens upon or after death is up to you and your belief system; this is merely discussing the present moment as it currently exists, where you are not dead and you certainly should not be thinking about death right now and, therefore, the divine likely isn\u2019t thinking about it either.)\nUnless, of course, \nyou\n don\u2019t honor \nyourself.\n\u00a0You don\u2019t believe that you should have healthy boundaries--where you resent yourself for reaching out to anyone in the first place--and how do we reach out to the divine specifically, other than through introspection and self-directed action?\n...It\u2019s kind of spooky, isn\u2019t it?\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is this: I want to share my wisdom. I want to tell you, honor your own inner divine voice. This is not necessarily restricted to the devout. I\u2019m talking about your higher self, as something that can (I think?) be defined by organic structures in the brain (or at least psychoanalysis). You can call it whatever you want. Freedom from suffering begins with self-directed compassion, and if embracing the divine helps you be self-compassionate, I say go for it.\nLook at it this way: no matter what path the river of compassion flows, do what you can to maintain that flow, or honor its existence. Ask for help from your inner divine voice first. Ask it, what do I need exactly, in a fundamental sense? (Think of this as an emotio-spiritual Ockham\u2019s Razor...you need to pinpoint what this need is. A language-based explanation or label might not be necessary, but I think at least a strong emotional energy-based impression is needed.) Then ask it, how would consulting with another human give me the knowledge to find what I need? Only then would it be honoring someone else--and therefore yourself--to ask for support. Because you\u2019re not trying to get what you need directly from this person...this is unrealistic, emotionally coercive, harmful, and self-defeating. You are asking for knowledge from others, and you will interpret this knowledge using your own intellect that you have gained from your own experience. You will then use this interpretation to make a judgement. When this judgement leads you to what you truly needed, you have gained wisdom. All of these forces have to be called upon with full knowledge that your experience of them does indeed shape them. Fundamentally, you must trust your own experience, but understand that this experience was likely colored by suffering. You must bear witness to your suffering without becoming it or making it your Truth.\nThese are all things that must be cultivated all the time, for all time. Imagine that your Self is a patch of earth. Cultivating comfort (read as: freedom from suffering) comes from planting honor in the ground. The watering of the soil is compassion; maybe you got the water from the aforementioned compassion river. The sun shining above is the divine. It is up to YOU to place the garden where the sun will strike and where the water is accessible!\u00a0\nNow, keep watering...and you might say, wow, I have all these comfort crops not just for me, but to share with others! Maybe others have begun watering the crops, too. Good for them! Should this mean that you stop watering? Assuming that freedom from suffering is, in fact, a perfectly sustainable agricultural phenomenon, then maybe ;) but for the purposes of this metaphor, it would be unwise of you to stop watering, because how can you trust that others, being human themselves, won\u2019t stop watering too and let the crops die? Then you will have effectively dropped the ball on others \nand \nyourself. And of course \u201cdivine intervention\u201d won\u2019t quite be enough; the divine/your wisdom shows you that water falling yields better crop...it is up to you to cultivate it.\u00a0\nThe trick is to, as paraphrased from Voltaire, tend to your own garden. Honor it. Honor others when they give and receive help. And honor yourself, because it all started with you. Honor the divine...as an aspect of or apart from yourself. Whatever works for you personally. Compassion is the water of life, but honor comprises the atoms in everything.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "calexsienne", "id": 160701779030, "date": "2017-05-15 18:12:20 GMT", "timestamp": 1494871940, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZhjZwj2LgaenM", "note_count": 2, "body": "I really wish people would stop referring to intracommunity bigotry as\u00a0\u201cdiscourse\u201d as if it\u2019s a level playing field."}, {"blog_name": "lesbianturtle", "id": 178842583495, "date": "2018-10-08 03:51:23 GMT", "timestamp": 1538970683, "tags": ["discourse", "sorry im just reading more about him and hhhh", "infinite lovers are still valid dont get me wrong", "its more of personal grudge", "cool character but reallyyy shitty person", "turtle talks", "sonic the hedgehog", "infinite", "cc hate"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zz3mnY2cZsK77", "note_count": 3, "body": "damn canon infinite is just a really shitty person lmao "}, {"blog_name": "my-girlfriend-loves-me", "id": 163360175804, "date": "2017-07-24 08:14:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1500884065, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZT9sYq2O91dQy", "note_count": 0, "body": "this website is so tiring... like, just let people like things please. literally saw a post about how Kickstarter and GoFundMe  are problematic. gofundme helped me a lot? please stop attacking people for just, living. you don't need to pick apart every little thing. don't you get tired? don't you want to enjoy life a little?"}, {"blog_name": "rab-bit-blog2", "id": 149267584013, "date": "2016-08-21 12:34:19 GMT", "timestamp": 1471782859, "tags": ["education", "social science", "discourse", "mine", "text post", "i just kinda. squint @ anyone who devalues social science like hmmmmmmmmmmm"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z-gPRm2B12fGD", "note_count": 5, "body": "part of me is uncomfortable with the fact that the social sciences are shot down and perceived as unimportant when they are the disciplines that are used to question societal power structures and relations/pretty much every to do with societies, cultures, intercultural relations and communications etc."}, {"blog_name": "toycarousel", "id": 180042507412, "date": "2018-11-12 19:39:36 GMT", "timestamp": 1542051576, "tags": ["important topics", "discourse", "sorta", "ask to tag if you need anything for stuff like this~!!!"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zej13u2dhNgIK", "note_count": 11, "body": "No one\u2019s actually gotten on my case about this yet, but I want to let people know I\u2019m totally aware that I talk too much/type too much, mainly when it comes to political or other emotionally charged topics, and the reason is that I\u2019m trying to include a lot of nuance on a forum that basically doesn\u2019t allow for it (video essays would be a way more effective thing for me to be doing, and I\u2019m gonna start up a YouTube channel along those lines, but yeah.\u00a0 Tumblr is where the arguments are rn, and it\u2019s the worst possible place for it to be happening).\nOn to the primary point: It\u2019s absolutely true that the snappy, witty, short posts end up being the most popular, and therefore widely-spread~!

You are correct, if you believe that, you would qualify as an exclusionist.\nThe inclusionist movement steals important, historical terms and warps them to reflect asexuals -- their whole movement is based around\u00a0\u201caphobia\u201d, which is literally stolen from homophobia! -- and don\u2019t seem to particularly care. Once they\u2019ve been warped and repurposed for inclusionists, they then fling it right back in the faces of anyone who is trying to disagree with them. I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve seen cishet ace people call themselves and other lgbt people queer unironically, or joke about the AIDs crisis, or call us Reactionary Exclusionist Gatekeepers (which is just transphobic beyond belief).\nAllosexual privilege is a hugely homophobic concept, and plays on the offensive stereotype of sexual deviancy and hypersexuality in lgbt people, along with just generally not being aware of the kind of western culture we live in, which promotes\u00a0\u201cpurity\u201d and\u00a0\u201cabstinence\u201d and equates sexual activity with sinfulness and deviancy.\nSo, basically, I personally believe that all inclusionists are homophobes and transphobes. They have no respect for the LGBT community, and view it as some kind of club, not a series of people who experience homophobia and transphobia and have banded together to make resources and safe places for people like them.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "aroaceacacia", "id": 676298552036737024, "date": "2022-02-15 23:42:39 GMT", "timestamp": 1644968559, "tags": ["discourse", "YES im posting this fuck it. someone on twt was a clown again. it was a small twt so i wont elaborate more", "but i needed to say this at least", "bearvocalizations"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z6hO8WbYiVCiGi00", "note_count": 89, "body": "any time people bring up the \"cleo defended this fic i dont like\" discourse I die inside please leave her alone let her live shes out there living her best life touching grass and the fact that you think her extremely kind and gracious attempts to make us get along are something to continue to wildly mischaracterize and hold against her makes me very very angry actually"}, {"blog_name": "catsnuggie", "id": 163380259954, "date": "2017-07-24 21:12:14 GMT", "timestamp": 1500930734, "tags": ["theres so much and its all so gatekeeping jesus christ", "can we just get along for once on this website", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZrsUkl2OAEEno", "note_count": 0, "body": "LGBT(QIA+) discourse is easily the most exhausting"}, {"blog_name": "twink-on-the-brink", "id": 177005503603, "date": "2018-08-15 00:45:04 GMT", "timestamp": 1534293904, "tags": ["shut up danny", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZZ0wOd2asMQHp", "note_count": 1, "body": "Discourse\nRick Astley is a twink and also looks quite similar to John Mulaney\nThe bartender from the music video is his bf\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "archivezinc", "id": 651649865085042688, "date": "2021-05-19 22:02:19 GMT", "timestamp": 1621461739, "tags": ["textpost", "calli.txt", "ranboo", "discourse", "discourse talk", "negative", "that One Part is about techno btw \ud83d\ude2d idk wont tag him though"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZdeLVTaB81c6Kq00", "note_count": 40, "body": "ive tolerated being on twt for months but i genuinely think the ranboo \"drama\" might've been the straw that broke the camel's back for me, if im being honest\nthe people on that site dont care about minorities; they don't care about helping anyone, or making any positive change, they care about having new targets to bully and harass and to send death threats to. whether that target be: a person who made insensitive poorly tasted jokes mostly 4-6 years ago that got dug up by some burner account, the fans of said person, or apparently now, a KID who's donated thousands of dollars to the trevor project. \nim really sorry for the negativity, i know the last thing all you guys probably want is for even MORE of that but this is the only place i can fully express my thoughts and do it without fear of harassment :') i use #discourse talk specifically for my blog so blacklist that if you dont wanna see this type of stuff !! <3"}, {"blog_name": "lemongogo", "id": 177255241525, "date": "2018-08-22 01:32:17 GMT", "timestamp": 1534901537, "tags": ["YALL !", "voltron critical", "discourse", "i always end up feeling bad after reading an interview"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZLRXUm2b5F5Sr", "note_count": 29, "body": "voltron day of silence but for jds and lm\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "reverbtwo", "id": 674996321679261696, "date": "2022-02-01 14:44:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1643726655, "tags": ["Personal", "Discourse", "Manatreed situation", "I'm done", "Negative", "I never want to interact with this fandom en mass anymore", "I still like the DSMP", "And I like the people I've met along the way", "But the rest of this fandom can go kiss the darkest part of my ass"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZqQWKTbU4PGAOq00", "note_count": 7, "body": "To the people who took a break and are/were panicking about the situation, I am so sorry your trauma has to be relieved through the sheer stupidity of a fandom whose only goal in this whole situation was to dox and expose a person\u2019s identity, whether it was their own or not.\u00a0\nPlease take as much time as you need and you don\u2019t need to owe \nanyone \nan explanation as to whether you leave or stay in the end.

I know that my posting right now is the last thing that anyone wants to see, but I feel that I need to address certain things specifically from my point of view. One, I feel the need to defend myself - and two, I don\u2019t want misinformation spreading around. \n\n\nI left my anon function turned on these last few days because people were kind enough to send me positive thoughts at a time when I needed them the most, and for that I\u2019m extremely grateful. But for every positive ask I received, there was another negative one in its wake, and those of course are the ones that I\u2019m the most troubled by. The anon function is now turned off because I\u2019ve been trying to maintain my distance, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult and I feel that some inquiries cannot go ignored. So I\u2019m going to address this confusion, hatred, and false accusations here, all at once. \n\n\nTo begin with - I acknowledge that I shouldn\u2019t have engaged with alw in the first place, specifically by responding with sarcasm instead of opening a civil dialogue. For that, I am entirely in the wrong. \n\n\nTo give context (though not trying to justify) simply know that her post showed up on the Phantom tag because it contained key-words, and I admittedly wasn\u2019t savvy enough at the time to know that untagged posts were not open for commentary. At that point, after a close friend had just dealt with their own conflict of similar origins, I was just fed-up with so many within the fandom being lumped together with actual misogynists simply for having particular tastes, and all without warrant from the one doing the accusing. I was warned to stay away from that individual because of their aggressiveness, though I didn\u2019t see the warning until later that day - long after the conflict began. \n\n\nBut even so, my fuck-up regarding that point ultimately doesn\u2019t matter - because I should have known better. That\u2019s the crux of it, and I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge that now even as I attempt to shed light on the entirety of my role in the situation. And know that I feel so unbelievably guilty about this that I truly don\u2019t know what to do, but I am sorry. I\u2019m just so sorry about all of this. I know how badly I fucked up, and I feel sure that I\u2019m no longer welcome here - I feel it every time I come to check my messages and anons, namely the ones so willing to assume the worst of me. \n\n\nBut at the end of the day, that\u2019s what happened, how it happened - I didn\u2019t necessarily go into this blindly, but I did go into this unaware of crucial site etiquette and with a shamefully uncivil approach. I made a mistake engaging in the first place, and believe me when I say I\u2019m paying for it. But I want everyone to understand what exactly compelled me to respond to begin with. \n\n\nTo address another point - one that I\u2019m legitimately concerned will follow me forever if I stay quiet - I will say again, and continue to do so if I have to: I AM NOT A RAPE APOLOGIST. I never said that it\u2019s acceptable or justifiable for celebrities - or anyone, for that matter - to manipulate/rape anyone that\u2019s under OR over the age of consent. Rape is a vile, evil, dehumanizing act that should never be justified or accepted - bar none. \n\n\nMy response to the Bowie post used as evidence against me was entirely about witch-hunts being such a large problem on this site, because people tend to go after others based on users saying so, and that perpetuation of mob-mentality is - quite frankly - very terrifying. We\u2019ve witness and experienced the effects firsthand. I do not agree with the user being addressed in the Bowie post, but Jesus it\u2019s frightening to see how readily and violently people attack rather than attempting to explain the flaw at the heart of the matter and perhaps reach someone they disagree with in a manner that affects change. \n\n\nAnd my earlier response to the Barbour post was long before I\u2019d had the chance to do my own research on the subject. At the time I didn\u2019t have enough information to form a strong opinion one way or another, and everything I\u2019ve learned in my adult life has taught me to research before speaking. Simple. And now I can say that my opinion of Barbour is definitely unfavorable, because I sincerely believe - based on the evidence I found - that he is guilty.\n\n\nThat said, I address these specific instances because I\u2019m so tired of being accused of condoning something that goes directly against my ideals, and thus I won\u2019t remain silent and allow my character to be dragged through the mud. Regardless of my mishandling of the initial situation with alw, to have those accusations leveled against me were outright unfair. So I\u2019m responding now once and for all - stop accusing me of being a rape-apologist. It isn\u2019t true. \n\n\nAnd honestly, I don\u2019t know what else to say anymore. I can only hope I\u2019ve made myself clear. \n\n\nI\u2019m so unbelievably sorry this happened, and I\u2019m going to bow out at this point in the hopes that my doing so will allow everyone else here to enjoy their time in the fandom. I am undecided on whether or not I\u2019m going to deactivate this account/take down my writing, but until that decision is made I will not be posting or responding unless directly requested to do so. I will check my messages periodically if anyone needs to talk, and I will do the same in FFN for the same reason. But I simply cannot be here right now - I\u2019ve created enough damage already and I feel that my presence will only create more, and I don\u2019t want anyone else getting hurt or to continue being hurt because of me. But I just needed to make this post to give my side. \n\n\nThank you to those that stood up for me and that have messaged me with your support.

Someone who\u2019s femme looks and acts the way they do not because it\u2019s what other people expect of them, but because it\u2019s part of who they are and what they want. That can include appearing feminine for the purpose of attracting women instead of men, but that\u2019s usually not the case. In fact historically (and still continuing today) femme cis women have been put down as \u201cappearing straight.\u201d Obviously that's neither true nor acceptable, but it does run counter to the idea that femme is solely about appearing feminine for other women.\nYou\u2019re right that it\u2019s about subverting femininity, and about sometimes being a gender, but neither of those uses are restricted to sapphics. Take a moment and think about what appearing feminine means for gay and bi men, who are already seen as woman-like by homophobes and therefore expected to be feminine, and who are sometimes put down by other gay men for not being manly enough (yep, toxic masculinity sure does suck and not just for straight men). Think about what it means for transfeminine people, for whom being feminine is considered a crime worth a death sentence to some transmisogynists. Think about what it means for transmasculine people, who are told their gender identity isn\u2019t real if they appear feminine in the slightest. Everyone who uses femme chooses to be feminine despite being told \u201cfemininity is for cis straight (white) women, you\u2019re not one of those so it\u2019s not for you, and femininity means you\u2019re weak, passive, and not in control of your own existence.\u201d Everyone who uses femme is saying \u201cno, femininity can be strong. It can be active. It can be a choice. I define what it means, and I define who I am.\u201d\nFemme has a long history in multiple communities so I\u2019m not going to say\u00a0\u201cthis is what it means, anyone who uses it differently is wrong,\u201d but it\u2019s the general impression I\u2019ve gotten from everyone I\u2019ve known, seen, or read about.

The licensed works were commissioned works by the Star Trek franchise and as such are technically part of the lore, but are somewhat separate from the show and movies. The books are kind of like... official fan fiction, if you will. The difficulty with weaving them together in the Star Trek universe is that the Star Trek universe is so intensely complex with multiverses and alternate realities and multiple timelines, so if you try to integrate some of the licensed works in with the Star Trek show canon, it\u2019s easy to get it wrong or contradict yourself.\nWith Voltron: Legendary Defender, what we see with the Paladin Handbook is a licensed work that the showrunners did not work on. Somebody separate worked on it, influenced by the show and things we know of the show due to leaks that haven\u2019t yet aired, and also influenced by things cast members have said in interviews that haven\u2019t been confirmed by showrunners. In addition, some of it is just made up information - like Lance\u2019s favorite food being Garlic Knots, or Keith\u2019s favorite animal being a hippo. Which is fine, that kind of thing adds flavor.\u00a0\nIn VLD the licensed work and the show canon can be woven together pretty seamlessly considered the simplicity of the show and the lack of information we currently have due to how early in the series we are. Technically we have only really seen 2.5 seasons, since season 3 was cut in half so Netflix could try out a different publishing schedule.\nThere\u2019s been a lot of arguing over the validity of the Handbook considering the showrunners did not have anything to do with it nor know what was in it, which is understandable, but something can be valid and also not canon.\nThe Handbook is an official licensed work, some information being made up arbitrarily, and some taken from the show and things the cast and showrunners have said. So it\u2019s part of the VLD universe, but it\u2019s not canon in the show. So it\u2019s sort of like headcanons that have been okayed by Dreamworks. Which you can use, and justify its use as being from an official source and not just your own made up idea, but it doesn\u2019t impact the canon of VLD. If the showrunners come out later saying\u00a0\u201cNo, Keith doesn\u2019t like hippos\u201d then Keith liking hippos is not canon but still comes from an official source.\nSo people headcanoning Lance as 18 even though the Paladin Handbook says he\u2019s 17 (we don\u2019t even know the timeline for the Handbook, so who knows if they are all still those ages) are just as valid as the people going by the Handbook, because none of the ages are canon - i.e., nothing is confirmed by the showrunners explicitly yet, or in the show.\nA side note: The things the VAs say about the show or their characters cannot be held as canon as they are not the showrunners and do not have the authority to make those sorts of decisions. If the VAs say something about the show or characters that are behind-the-scenes backed up by showrunners, until \nshowrunners\n\u00a0explicitly state it or it is introduced in the show, it is not canon.\nSo basically, y\u2019all are too worked up over what\u2019s canon and not canon. You don\u2019t need to throw out the validity of the Handbook because the showrunners said they didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. So it\u2019s not canon, whatever, but it\u2019s still licensed work.\nBasically."}, {"blog_name": "mystrothedefender", "id": 163479439277, "date": "2017-07-27 08:13:39 GMT", "timestamp": 1501143219, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZIPoNv2OG8aUj", "note_count": 2, "body": "Just for the record genderbends of all kinds suck, genderbends of trans characters are 3x worse."}, {"blog_name": "disasterlarper", "id": 142218511611, "date": "2016-04-04 03:47:17 GMT", "timestamp": 1459741637, "tags": ["THATS PRETTY HINDERING IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF", "Discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7UlMx24SuaJx", "note_count": 9, "body": "drkrankenstein\ncaliborn is NEUROATYPICAL not ill because he isnt suffering or hindered in anyway\nHE KILLS PEOPLE\nHE BIT OFF HIS OWN LEG\n?????????????????????????????????????"}, {"blog_name": "blades4dream", "id": 668771798677078016, "date": "2021-11-24 21:48:07 GMT", "timestamp": 1637790487, "tags": ["when I talk about his range this is Not what I mean :/", "dreamwastaken", "nasatalks", "discourse", "maybe"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZOIcxYb7z6XNya00", "note_count": 19, "body": "dream joking about hasan having a car despite being anti capitalist and then showing his support to youtube\u2019s resident mr capitalism all within an hour"}, {"blog_name": "millicentthecat", "id": 144210658771, "date": "2016-05-11 19:21:51 GMT", "timestamp": 1462994511, "tags": ["Ben Solo", "discourse", "finn", "dialogue", "deadnaming", "response", "sort of"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7ED1i26Je0NJ", "note_count": 8, "body": "@galadhir\n on \nthis thread\nI am also very keen on the idea of a pacifist hero. \u00a0It's why I'm deeply in love with Threepio.\nTotally feeling you on the Ben Solo thing. \u00a0I think I've written before about how uncomfortable it made me to see Han deadname Kylo? \u00a0(I know I used that in \na reylo snippet\n. \u00a0I don't know if those thoughts ever made it into any actual meta.)\nohtze and seankayos had a really \ngood thread here\n about the Ben-Kylo problem. \u00a0(I think it\u2019s from awhile ago.)\nI\u2019ll make a separate post about Finn theories at some point. \u00a0I put his on-screen kill count around 8-9 stormtroopers - several on the \nFinalizer \nand one on Takodana."}, {"blog_name": "rittapokie", "id": 176001700790, "date": "2018-07-17 23:40:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1531870802, "tags": ["personal", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPC3fd2ZwXDEs", "note_count": 1, "body": "Everyone making and reblogging \u201cwhat if everyone making less than a living wage just didn\u2019t show up to work for 1 day\u201d and \u201ccapitalism only functions when you participate in it\u201d posts makes a living wage and has job security"}, {"blog_name": "weirdgirlcore", "id": 175987197312, "date": "2018-07-17 14:46:55 GMT", "timestamp": 1531838815, "tags": ["if u dont like me idc thats chill but i wanna rb the new promo stuff thanks", "someone who hasnt blocked me post the new promos so i can have em on my blog pls", "shut up lev", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7PoWa2ZvfuM0", "note_count": 6, "body": "like half the ppl who post new shit in the sunny fandom have me blocked guess ill die"}, {"blog_name": "iprefersarcasm", "id": 659062024950759424, "date": "2021-08-09 17:35:26 GMT", "timestamp": 1628530526, "tags": ["politics", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZCB2EsabTMjw8y00", "note_count": 1, "body": "why is everything controversial I'm so tired "}, {"blog_name": "graceiknz", "id": 178083609767, "date": "2018-09-14 19:11:07 GMT", "timestamp": 1536952267, "tags": ["discourse", "shut up now grace", "i will", "just...stop that"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZcicZu2bsd3od", "note_count": 1, "body": "\"Cant believe y'all aren't talking about this\" is code for \"I feel superior to everyone else because I possess a piece of information others - through no fault of their own due to actually having lives separate from and as a priority to internet discourse - are unaware of\" "}, {"blog_name": "amberpeltsstuff", "id": 652578113739505664, "date": "2021-05-30 03:56:26 GMT", "timestamp": 1622346986, "tags": ["tw discourse", "mcc", "tw rant", "discourse", "myctblr", "mycttwt"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZZEdvVaER5P1eq00", "note_count": 8, "body": "Ok a quick rant-\nOne thing that does annoy me is here we say all the positivity about the streamers and say all how much we hate Twitter but it just bothers me that it doesn't do shit because the CCs dont see it and alot  of us dont even dare say these thingys on Twitter(and i understand why-).

Here\u2019s a brief quote from his workshop notes, which can be found \nhere\n:\nIt is possible to engage with the sense of personal failure in a way that provides for a reading of this as a refusal of modern power.\nIn the shadows of personal failure, other knowledges of life and practices of living can be identified and more richly appreciated.\nThis can provide a foundation for people to more significantly pursue identity projects that do not so completely reproduce the favoured individualities of contemporary culture.\nnotational\n:\n\u201cWhat kind of rewards can failure offer us? Perhaps most obviously, failure allows us to escape the punishing norms that discipline behavior and manage human development with the goal of delivering us from unruly childhoods to orderly and predictable adulthoods. Failure preserves some of the wondrous anarchy of childhood and disturbs the supposedly clean boundaries between adults and children, winners and losers. And while failure certainly comes accompanied by a host of negative affects, such as disappointment, disillusionment, and despair, it also provides the opportunity to use those negative affects to poke holes in the toxic positivity of contemporary life. As Barbara Ehrenreich reminds us in Brightsided, positive thinking is a North American affliction, a \u2018mass delusion\u2019 that emerges out of a combination of American exceptionalism and a desire to believe that success happens to good people and failure is just a consequence of a bad attitude rather than structural conditions (2009: 13). Positive thinking is offered up in the U.S. as a cure for cancer, a path to untold riches, and a surefire way to engineer your own success. Indeed believing that success depends upon one\u2019s attitude is far preferable to Americans than recognizing that their success is the outcome of the titled scales of race, class, and gender. As Ehrenreich puts it, \u2018if optimism is the key to material success, and if you can achieve an optimistic outlook through the discipline of positive thinking, then there is no excuse for failure.\u2019 But, she continues, \u2018the flip side of positivity is thus a harsh insistence on personal responsibility,\u2019 meaning that while capitalism produces some people\u2019s success through other people\u2019s failures, the ideology of positive thinking insists that success depends only upon working hard and failure is always of your own doing (8). We know better of course in an age when the banks that ripped off ordinary people have been deemed \u2018too big to fail\u2019 and the people who bought bad mortgages are simply too little to care about.\u201d\n\u2014 Judith Halberstam, \nThe Queer Art of Failure"}, {"blog_name": "spiderblock-blog", "id": 164521543946, "date": "2017-08-23 13:52:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1503496366, "tags": ["discourse", "discourser", "lgbtq positivity", "aro discourse", "ace discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zq9Dtf2PEFuaA", "note_count": 367, "body": "When exclusionists refer to lgbt spaces or resources being stolen by cishets, we aren't referring to like the qu*er tag or even pride parades!

Do I believe that lesbians and bi women have the male gaze? Of course not. We\u2019re not men.\u00a0So what could I, a lesbian, possibly have to question about the way we speak about this?\nWell, there are things that that I hear repeated over and over and over again on here: \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad for finding women attractive!\u00a0You're a woman, so you can\u00a0never have the male gaze! You will never treat women the way that men treat women!\u201d And yes, I also agree on those points. I\u2019m not a man nor was I socialized as one. Check. Because of this, I also know that I will never treat women the way that men have socially and historically treated women. Check. I love being a lesbian and I don\u2019t feel bad about being naturally disposed to find women attractive and simultaneously, to not find men attractive. Check. So once again, what seems to be my issue?\nWhen I\u2019m in public and I see a beautiful woman and she has nice tiddies... I\u2019m going to stare at her tiddies. What can I say? I\u2019m a boob gal. But this is where the bad feelings come in. This is where I start to feel like an awful person and it took me a while to understand why. The reason why I feel bad for looking at women in this way is because\u00a0I don\u2019t like men looking at me in that way. And would you believe it\u00a0has \nabsolutely nothing\n to do with any perceived disrespect that a man might be giving me? I know I would never give myself whiplash to look at a woman\u2019s ass on the street -- the way men have done to me. I know I will never look at a women\u2019s breasts while she\u2019s trying to hold a conversation with me -- the way men have done to me.\u00a0I know I will never touch a stranger on her leg or ass, try to corner her in an empty space, call her misogynistic slurs, scream obscenities at her from a moving car -- the way men have done to me. And that is precisely the reason why I feel so bad for looking at women in a respectful way. Because a\u00a0man could look at me in the most respectful, healthy, non-violent, non-objectifying way and \nI would still be uncomfortable with it\n. Why? Because I don\u2019t have the biological capacity to be\u00a0attracted to them and leaving out any discomfort that a woman may feel from the residual effects of millennia upon millennia of men objectifying women, this is the reason\u00a0I simply don\u2019t like them looking at me.\u00a0\nNow what does this have to do with me looking at women? Well, from listening to other lesbian and bi women on this site who have been brave enough to have had encounters with straight women, I get the impression that some straight women reaaaaally do not like being hit on by lesbians or bi women. It makes them uncomfortable. And excluding reactions which have to do with homophobia, in some cases, these women do feel genuine unease with another \u00a0women\u2019s (sexual) gaze\u00a0in instances where we\u2019re being completely respectful, healthy, non-violent, and non-objectifying. Much like my reaction to men who look at me, they feel this way because they don\u2019t want to be looked at in a sexual manner from people they have no capacity to feel attraction for.\u00a0\nThis\n is where my problem with how we talk about the male gaze comes in because I feel like it\u2019s absolutely unhelpful for women like me who understand and are observant of the specific loci of these reactions. We\u2019re not few and far in-between, you know? I\u2019m convinced that this is how most of us are thinking.\u00a0Lots of women who you\u2019re telling they\u2019re not creeps\u00a0\nknow\n they\u2019re not creeps. We \nknow\n\u00a0that passing by a beautiful woman and glancing at her because we find her sexually attractive doesn\u2019t make us in any way like men. And yet we still feel uncomfortable doing so because we\u2019ve felt that unease before. As women, we know that unease like the back of our hands. And I never want to make another woman feel that unease, regardless of how respectful I\u2019m being.\nPhwew! There\u2019s more.\u00a0Ultimately, this is all tied to the way we define that specific gaze and the male gaze in general. If the male gaze is simply defined as a disrespectful or objectifying gaze by a man, then\u00a0by that definition, do men who \ndon\u2019t\n look at women as a pair of tiddies not have the male gaze? Are men who don\u2019t shout out of passing cars and don\u2019t invade your physical space to make sexual comments towards you\u00a0\nnot \nholders of the male gaze?\u00a0Are they just as free of it as I am? An argument could be made that even if their gaze is presented in a respectful manner, that they were still socialized in a society that defines women as beings which are no more than the sum of our body parts. But was I, a lesbian, not raised in that same society? Now, on the flip side, if we\u2019re defining the male gaze as looking at a woman in a way that makes her uneasy or uncomfortable, then yes, I have\n a gaze\n. Maybe not the \nmale\n gaze, but a gaze that is unwanted at best, so telling me that I don\u2019t have the male gaze does nothing because a person -- through no fault of either one of us -- is still feeling uncomfortable on the other end of it.\u00a0\nAnd it is this second definition that makes me question why we\u2019re constantly doing this dance around the male gaze and what it means for lesbians and bi women to look at other women. What\u2019s the point? There are women out there who will feel uncomfortable by\u00a0me and any other lesbian or bi woman looking at them in a sexual manner. Sure, you can tell us to not feel bad about that, but I feel bad about it precisely because I\u2019m a woman and I find a man\u2019s gaze to be so traumatic to the point that I would never want to make another woman feel that way. So telling me that I\u2019m not doing X, Y, and Z \nwhen I\u2019m totally doing X, Y, and Z\n is just... it feels like a lie?\u00a0I don\u2019t know, I just want a consensus on what we\u2019re all using to define the male gaze so I can be understanding, for once-and-for-all, what it is that makes me looking at a women\u2019s tiddies soooooo different from a man looking at a women\u2019s tiddies. Because if it\u2019s simply,\u00a0\u201cLooking at a woman and being a man\u201d then there\u2019s nothing that bad about the male gaze. At least nothing that a man could help. But if there\u2019s nothing bad about the male gaze, why do we speak of it in such a negative way to the point where we\u2019re all but shouting at lesbians and bi women,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry! You don\u2019t have this terrible thing! You don\u2019t do this, I promise!\u201d\u00a0So, does anyone want to help me out here? You tell me. In what way is me gazing at your tiddies any different from a man doing it?\u00a0I\u2019m being serious."}, {"blog_name": "voidsuma", "id": 656415153802379264, "date": "2021-07-11 12:24:33 GMT", "timestamp": 1626006273, "tags": ["discourse", "im so sick of seeing it on my timeline it's time to mute and unfollow a few people", "like???

How about instead of worsening the mental health of teens and young adults who are not at all prepared for this kind of spotlight, we go cancel and callout DISNEY? Because I guess these people haven\u2019t realized, but when you get angry at a creator for saying something that offended a group of people, and instead of informing, you choose to dox and/or threaten them, you aren\u2019t teaching them how and why that was offensive.

Just because Zack and Ray are fictional characters, that doesn\u2019t mean that by shipping them, it can be harmful. The act itself, of shipping them, can desensitize someone. It normalizes the behavior and basically makes it so that they think it\u2019s \nokay\n. By compartmentalizing this, you\u2019re making yourself believe that it\u2019s \nokay \nfor relationships to exist, fictional or not. If you keep internalizing it, who knows, you might just develop something. And also, by saying that you\u00a0\u2018just don\u2019t care\u2019 means the same as the fact that you\u2019re excusing it. You\u2019re overlooking the fact that they\u2019ve got an age gap.\u00a0\nTo the next point, yes both are very not mentally stable people. Zack has his own issues, Ray has her own. The hypothetical relationship people keep putting them into is already unhealthy because one, the age gap; and two, because they\u2019re both unfit for a relationship. There shouldn\u2019t be any circumstance that a child, mentally ill or not, would be shipped with an adult.\u00a0\nThe next thing you said isn\u2019t even viable as an argument. They aren\u2019t even in Japan. It\u2019s not implied where the game actually takes place, but just from their names you can tell none of the characters are Japanese. Therefore, the age of consent argument you gave isn\u2019t valid. Even still, if it \nwere \napplicable, Zack still shouldn\u2019t be able to have sex with Ray. According to an article linked in the official website for the American Embassy in Japan, the male must be 18 or older, and the female must be 16 or older. The Child Welfare Act also says that\u00a0\u2018act of fornication to children\u2019 is not allowed. This means that\u00a0sex with an individual to which one is not married, shouldn\u2019t be allowed. Ray is not married. She is under 18. She is a minor and should not be, in any circumstance, in a sexual relationship with Zack.\nAnd to finish up, I guess I am judging? But I can\u2019t stand around to see people shipping a literal minor with an adult. It\u2019s just against my morals, and I \nwill\n\u00a0stand against it.\nLabel me an anti, I don\u2019t mind.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "baked-mashed-potato", "id": 158389183349, "date": "2017-03-14 10:25:24 GMT", "timestamp": 1489487124, "tags": ["voltron", "discourse", "jellybns bullshit", "im really sorry you guys have to see this", "like", "i hate seeing discourse on my dash to", "but i just want to remind everyone that i love you all", "stay safe!"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZNa_vn2JWkoDr", "note_count": 26, "body": "please feel free to ignore lmfao\nyou know im so sorry that you guys have to see this on your dashboards so honestly if youre avoiding discourse just ignore this entire post. its brief(?) and not going to get into any specifics but its just a small thing i wanted to say.\ni like to think of my blog as relatively positive even if i dont promote it as such. i generally avoid posting anything discourse related (jokes on me im posting about it now) because i know im tired of it and im sure most of you guys are tired of it too.\nbut recently a lot of the people i love, whether it be artists i admire or friends or just random people i see on my dash, theyve been getting a lot of negativity from people who think their advice is well placed. i\u2019m not trying to call out these people because trust me i have done this many more times than i can count. its really gotten to the point where there is something to fault in almost anything.\njust, if youre going to put an opinion out there, please be respectful. please always keep in mind that there is someone behind that screen, \u00a0and you dont want to be responsible for the actions they may take when you push something too far.\nIf youre a follower, just know that i dont mind what sort of things you are for or against. as long as you are respectful and kind about it, i love you even if i cant always show my appreciation (sorry about that orz)\nStay safe and happy blogging!"}, {"blog_name": "ghost-taxi", "id": 179119787098, "date": "2018-10-16 18:46:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1539715588, "tags": ["discourse", "emily talks"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZvFuZo2cqNmnQ", "note_count": 1, "body": "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s funnier, the fact that people can\u2019t believe ao3 had raised so much money or the people who are personally offended by it "}, {"blog_name": "impermanent-marker", "id": 162906547017, "date": "2017-07-12 17:40:21 GMT", "timestamp": 1499881221, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZURl2k2Nj-AD9", "note_count": 7, "body": "people really don't know the difference between something being socially difficult and something being oppressive, and its really at the root of a lot of our worst #discourse.\n\nall the debates about \"are het ace people/ het poly people/ kinksters queer\"? would be resolved in a second if people realized that personal prejudices are only oppressive when there's the threat of systematic violence behind them.\n\nnot all harm comes from oppression. not all difficulties in life come from oppression. oppression is a big word and we shouldn't diminish it."}, {"blog_name": "dragonlordofmiddleearth", "id": 163843161980, "date": "2017-08-05 22:13:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1501971205, "tags": ["bbc merlin", "gaius", "discourse", "I guess", "though I think pretty much everyone in the fandom agrees", "gaius is completely useless", "I'm sure he means well", "but that counts for nothing at this point", "sigh", "merlin deserved better guardians", "then maybe less shit would have happened"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZytBOj2Obq3zy", "note_count": 3, "body": "So I just rewatched The Wicked Day again and I noticed something for the first time that literally annoyed me for the rest of the episode.\nThe magic backfires, Uther's dead etc etc and Gaius says to Merlin \"look at this necklace I found on Uther that backfired all your magic and killed him instead.

Yay!)\nJust so we\u2019re clear where I am coming from, \nI don\u2019t like LGBTmazight\n. I\u2019ve never interacted with her directly, but she has attacked friends I have made in this fandom with insults and (in my opinion, unfair) accusations. So my dislike comes from the fact that I\u2019ve had a front seat to the aftermath.\nYou may have seen other people talking about how she - a supposed champion of POC and MENA people - has been instrumental in making the fandom a toxic place for them?\u00a0Well, I can attest to that. I personally know people of \nMENA, \n\n\nItalian, \n\n\nLatin American, Southeast Asian and Jewish\n descent who\u2019ve been the targets of harassment by her and her followers. Merely for disagreeing with her opinion, or just for the cardinal sin of being on\u00a0\u201cthe other side\u201d. And this has been going on for the better part of the past year.\nAnd after all that, to find out that this is just the latest episode in years of faking her life experiences and identity? That her authority in the fandom - which she used as her shield, her source of power - was based on lies?\u00a0\nLGBTmazight, do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done?\n How many people have left this fandom because of the attacks you have instigated and egged on? How many angry, frustrated and scared people you have left in your wake? How many voices that were lost? Are you even the least bit sorry for some of them?\nAnd incidentally, to her defenders, please stop trying to deflect from the issue by wholesale accusing people who interacted with the post of being Top!Joe stans, or racists. If you really want to talk racism, \nLGBTmazight has been one of the leading promoters of the phrase\u00a0\u201cPOC can be racist too\u201d in this fandom\n, and her followers took this as a greenlight to bully the\u00a0\u2018bad POCs\u2019 just because their\u00a0\u2018good POC\u2019 friend said so. And that is why the racefaking really cuts deep.\nBUT ... \nthe last thing this fandom needs is a situation where both sides mindlessly accuse the other of racism\n. So please, just listen to what people are saying and asking of you. An apology would do a lot to heal the wounds in this fandom. And then maybe we can go back to our respective corners and just focus on creating more content.

We are living in an age of call outs and black lists, some people are itching to make them and most people are walking on eggshells to not be on them. Not to say that call outs are made frivilously, because yes I\u2019m glad I know now that six/pencee literally had a child slave, but things can definitely get blown out of proportion when people don\u2019t know how to fact check. There\u2019s been recent discourse, for lack of a better term, as to whether shipping should be considered activism or not, disclaimer, I don\u2019t believe it is. This has made it so people judge others based on what they ship, as if by shipping an interracial couple they\u2019re suddenly excempt from being racist. By believing that shipping is activism, people will pick who they ship based off of arbitrary minority points and for whatever reason attack people who ship differently.\u00a0\nThis is literally just a ship war disguised as a morality crusade. You can dislike ships, you can flat out think ships are vile and immoral, but it\u2019s still just a notp. Learn to blacklist like the rest of us and move on. Because here\u2019s the thing, people are into fucked up shit! Let them vent and express safely and not hate themselves for it. I understand that it\u2019s not the best way to express yourself, I understand that harmful coping mechanisms shouldn\u2019t be encouraged, but you don\u2019t know other people\u2019s lives. You aren\u2019t their parent, you don\u2019t have to take care of them, and you have no right to control them. You have no right to make them divulge their entire life so that way they\u2019re allowed to have dark themes in their online experience. Let people deal how they can. If it\u2019s just a band-aid fix for now then they\u2019ll have to deal with that later,but you aren\u2019t responsible for them.\nAnother thing that I want to point out, specifically for Voltron, is that there\u2019s this thing called\u00a0\u201cWord of God\u201d canon. It\u2019s kind of an old term. I first encountered it when JK R0wling started interacting with fans via twitter. She has said some things to add to H@rry Potter lore and world-building after the series was over, which was good in some cases and cringeworthy in others. Ex. Du/mbledore being gay & Wizards just pooping and peeing anywhere then just vanishing it, respectively. So people didn\u2019t just accept all of these\u00a0\u2018canonizations\u2019 she put forward and so I learned the term\u00a0\u201cWord of God\u201d canon. It\u2019s simply information that comes from respectable sources, but not from the original content itself and therefore if chosen can be ignored. It\u2019s often used to validate popular headcanons and fanon material, but at the end of the day, it wasn\u2019t in the source material, casual fans might not even know of it\u2019s existence. I bring this up because all of the ages that have been put out there have not been in the actual show. All of the books and con videos are rejectable. People don\u2019t have to accept them if they disagree. Honestly, even if they release ages in the show, people still don\u2019t have to agree if it doesn\u2019t make sense to them. It\u2019s just how fandom is and has always been. People take parts of the canon they like and put it in an au, they change just one fact to make it more palletable. People are self-indulgent and they should be allowed to be in fandom. None of this is canon. The only thing that should matter is if it makes you happy or not. If you can only enjoy a ship under very specific circumstances, that\u2019s fine! If you could watch them fall in love through every au possible that\u2019s just as fine!\nJust learn to like things in your own way and allow other people to enjoy stuff in theirs. You don\u2019t have to support it, you can literally just say yikes and block them, but making vague posts and generalizations about\u00a0\u201cthat side of the fandom\u201d or whatever your on about today is just going to make all of us unhappy. Because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s people against ships that don\u2019t send death threats, don\u2019t send anon hate, don\u2019t make jokes about \u201c_ ship found dead in miami\u201d and all that pettiness and cruelty in the same way I\u2019m sure that there are pro-shippers that aren\u2019t just\u00a0\u201canything goes, all content exists in a vacuum, fiction does nothing to affect reality\u201d because I\u2019m one of them. But until we find a middle ground, pro-shippers will instinctively protect those that stand with them in the same way people with notps will stand with an/ti shippers. We both want to enjoy fandom. There is room for both being critical of yourself and the media you consume and still consuming it your own way."}, {"blog_name": "waddei", "id": 674751629308952576, "date": "2022-01-29 21:54:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1643493298, "tags": ["discourse", "dream smp", "meta discourse", "im a toxic inniter sorry"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z9y_CVbTCmWeau00", "note_count": 45, "body": "this was incredibly disappointing, the whole stream felt like it was leading up to something big,,, but nothing happened, i genuinely feel like they've baited us like three times in a row\nSam was incredibly sus the entire time but we got nothing this stream, so it just feels like a drawn out setup\neverything when they where coming back for Micheal seem to lead to Sam being there already/ Micheal Being gone,  but we got none of that\nthen we have ghostboo in the window, that scene had some incredible potential but it was just,,, so dull. he said 3 lines and then just stood there as techno and tubbo celebrated\nand don't even get me started in tubbo trusting TECHNO more than eret\njust.. ugh\nalso no ctommy mention"}, {"blog_name": "petejmoss-blog", "id": 181186830371, "date": "2018-12-17 02:52:53 GMT", "timestamp": 1545015173, "tags": ["common sense", "apparently not", "discourse", "damn", "youtube", "opinion"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZiEsBY2elaw0Z", "note_count": 1, "body": "I'm really sick of these people who post things on YouTube or any other website really, and then get upset when people react negatively to their content.

That does not negate the trauma other characters faced from his actions, nor does it absolve him entirely, but his perspective is understandable.\nHowever, I find it absolutely hilarious that of all the possible defenses he could have made, he went with blaming c!Tommy, who repeatedly tried to talk c!Wilbur down from his plan to destroy Manberg (and partially succeeded when Wilbur had second thoughts), and... c!Tubbo, who only said the code phrase under repeated \npeer pressure\n promptings from Schlatt, and who Techno \nliterally killed?\nYeah, I've got a whole lot of thoughts on that.\nOnce you factor in the statements to and from other characters that imply Techno knew and approved of the plan to blow up Manberg (or at least that Tubbo and Tommy believed he knew), I'm inclined to believe that this entire clusterfuck of discourse comes from cc miscommunication, like so many other issues.

That that is, in fact, one of the things that makes art so important.\nI think it\u2019s important that we all keep in mind that someone can look at the same piece of art we do, and experience entirely different emotions, and that none of those emotions are wrong. Exploration of horrifying things and our fascination with those things is as old as art itself, and as long as we remain critical of our behavior and attitudes in the real world, there\u2019s not a damn thing wrong with enjoying the ways that fiction makes us feel.\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "deleto000000-blog", "id": 153024889218, "date": "2016-11-11 04:42:29 GMT", "timestamp": 1478839349, "tags": ["devereuxop", "discourse", "text post"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZoGG_h2EW-e62", "note_count": 4, "body": "cishet and shithead basically rhyme I see no coincidence"}, {"blog_name": "prjctdiva", "id": 181257597451, "date": "2018-12-20 01:35:11 GMT", "timestamp": 1545269711, "tags": ["i'm tired", "fuck right off", "nik speaks", "discourse", "ig"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZDo2tX2epot8B", "note_count": 11, "body": "reminder to terfs to keep your filthy disgusting hands off my posts.

And let\u2019s talk about how a/cxa is suddenly in love with k/eith like, that was absolutely unnecessary, it did nothing for the plot and is just adding unnecesary hetero romance that had absolutely no build up whatsoever\n3. And about a/dashi.... wtf? all we got from adam was a break up flashback and like ten seconds (?) of him in a ship before he dies. He had so little screen time that my screen froze for a sec and I missed his death ffs. Is this really the rep they are so proud of? An unstated relationship that has three ten-second scenes at best and ends with 1/2 of the ship being dead? What kind of message does this send to us lgbt fans that were hoping to get represented?\n4. L/ance\u2019s sword.... where is it? the only reason they included that scene in season 5 was to further a/llura\u2019s elektra complex, it\u2019s literally never been brought up again.\n5. k/eith suddenly dislikes l/ance again and at this point im starting to doubt if they are even going to become good supporting friends by the end of the show. All their season 3 development? gone, vanished, it didn\u2019t happen. They will become teammates and friends and that\u2019s it, who cares that their relationship was one of the most focused from seasons 1-3, whatever happened to being his right-hand man.\n6. Like k/eith was an absolute asshole and really very ooc. He's always wanted to get closer to l/ance and now when l/ance is genuine with him he acts like a jerk? Yeah that\u2019s not k/eith\n7. Why was James given so much screen time he was k/eith's bully, he wasn't even sorry for what he said, I don't give two sh*ts about him.\n8. to be honest I can\u2019t even talk about the plot because i couldn\u2019t bring myself to pay atention for more than 5 minutes in the second half. The garrison and the earth colours were so bland they bored me so much. They introduced so many new characters and vehicles and weapons and complex technical words I just couldn\u2019t keep up.\n9. Lance. Is not. Dumb.\n10. Oh sorry what is Lance\u2019s development again?\n11. We were told l/ance would be comforted after being isolated for three f*cking seasons.\n12. We were told they would talk about k/eith\u2019s almost self sacrifice.\n13. we were told s/hiro would have a chat with l/ance.\n14. Is this even a kids\u2019 show? Because this voltron is defenitely not the voltron i started watching with the bright colours and characters with potential and good dynamics. I don\u2019t want this voltron.\nAbout e/zor and z/ethrid i dont even know if that's a good thing? Again \nthey are being vague so i'm not even completely sure that they are gfs, \nbut if they are, making two villains wlw? Hm. Im not too happy ngl (they were really going to torture the paladins hadn\u2019t they been stopped what kind of rep-)\nFurthermore there are just way too many things that don\u2019t make any sense/are completely unnecessary with the direction this series is going\nGood things that happened tho?\n1.

This is partially what I mean by this. \n\nNot only do I find most 'debates' a monumental waste of time, but I also find that they (or calls for 'rational' debate) are a great silencing tactic often used by the privileged parties in the discussion. As such, they are also a form of respectability politics[^2] and/or a form of tone policing. \n\nThat this is the case is pretty evident in the comments in [that d00d's critique of the ALA's new Code of Conduct](http://www.donotlink.com/cF2). Most of the reactionary comments invoke a kind of nostalgic fiction about 'civil' and 'respectful' discourse that has likely never existed in the 'hundred years' that the ALA hasn't had a code of conduct. Also present is many calls of 'can't we all just be adults,' which is terrifically amusing given the high pitched whining. \n\nThis sort of nostalgia about fictitious civil discourse is, of course, massively damaging to marginalized people. It isn't up for debate that librarians and the library world is largely populated by white people (white cis women, to be super exact). The interesting thing is that the ALA's new code does nothing to address the institutional and systemic racism that perpetuates this fairly homogeneous labour pool. All it does is, perhaps, encourage those of us already in the field to actually participate, since we'll know that -- as always happens -- when something racist is said, we might actually be able to do something about it without, you know, destroying our careers. \n\nIt is further interesting that given the huge gender imbalance (far more women than men), that an anti-harassment policy is still necessary. And, worse, men in the comments of the post still seem to think that because no one is telling them about getting harassed, it clearly isn't happening. Of course, this is a result of librarianship, despite having a majority of women, being embedded in a larger misogynist society, such that we cannot even assume safety in a space where we greatly outnumber men. \n\nBut somehow... I'm supposed to interpret this as civil and respectful discourse? When men like him clearly only care about their own rights and not whether everyone has the same ability to exercise the same rights. It is also expected that I smile pretty and carefully placate his delicately bruised white man's ego. I mean... this is what Asian girls are for, amirite?\n\nAlso supposed to be nice about smug \"I gotcha\"s from other men defending this:\n\n> And again, I would note how much of the criticism of his post would not pass muster under the rules themselves. [source](https://twitter.com/librarythingtim/status/417865243453181953)\n\nWhich is interesting, given that I didn't know that I was at the ALA Midwinter and thus bound by their code of conduct.... even if what he is saying is true.\n\nThe thing about all of this is that it fundamentally doesn't recognize how the current liberal notion of civil discourse is inherently hostile to most people who are not white men, given that these notions were developed at a time when the only citizens were.... white men. But even going further back to the foundations of modern civil discourse, the age of rationality, to men like Kant, Locke, Liebniz, Hume, etc., most of them didn't even consider people of colour human beings (and didn't really think much better of women). \n\nThis is a discourse that was never designed or intended to include people like me. Not then and not now. \n\nMore to the point, it also fails to recognize the fundamental ways that calls of 'respectability' in civil discourse often ends up being more about ensuring that one privileged group is able to maintain hegemonic control over the discourse. \n\nAnd we can see this in the apparently sacrosanct values of 'entirely unrestricted freedom of expression' or even of 'civil and rational discourse.' The way people go on and on about these things without ever once realizing that, just maybe, these values are not universally shared demonstrates just how firm their belief that their values, their opinions, their desires should be allowed to structure and frame all discourse.\n\nI don't share these values. Freedom of expression -- [as also confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada](http://canlii.ca/en/ca/scc/doc/2013/2013scc11/2013scc11.html) -- requires some restrictions to ensure equitable abilities for all people to, well, actually have freedom of expression in any meaningful sense. \n\nThat I don't believe in 'civil' or 'rational' discourse ought to be evident from my writing and how I approach most of the topics I discuss. [My experiment in professionalism](http://satifice.com/2013/11/27/an-experiment-in-professionalism/) quite explicitly states:\n\n>I\u2019m not very interested in being or appearing \u2018professional\u2019 if it means that I have to leave my humanity behind.\n\nAs human being, I have feelings, emotions, and all the rest. I'm not going to excise these parts of myself just to conform to a historically racist and sexist notion civil discourse. \n\nMore importantly, [this comment actually highlights a personal goal](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6981961):\n\n>>I know several women in the industry, from marketing wizard to expert programmer with publish credits, who have to tip toe when they go to a company because men are being trained that all women are like Shanley in the industry\n\n>And that is what pisses me off about this kind of nonsense. If it was just idiots being idiots I wouldn't care, but this shit actually affects people. My wife doesn't to go to conferences or involve herself in the programming world outside of directly doing her job any more because she feels like everyone is afraid to talk near her much less to her, for fear of losing their job over something they said.\n\nD00d is saying that this is a bad thing, but this is (in part) exactly what I want. I want white people to only interact with me using their best behaviour and actively thinking about what they say. I want men to do this as well. And, if they can't, I want them to know enough about me that they will stay far, far away. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause I'm tired of gritting my teeth and smiling through racist comment, after sexist comment, after microaggression, etc. \n\nI actually want to live in a world (even if just professionally) where oppressive comments and behaviours are punished more severely than speaking [speaking up about it is](http://ashedryden.com/the-risk-in-speaking-up). And if I can't live in this world? I'm petty enough that I'll accept a small bubble of personal space where people who can't express themselves without saying something heinous just leave me alone. \n\n[^1]: [Translation from Burton Watson](http://terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu.html#2): \"Suppose you and I have had an argument. If you have beaten me instead of my beating you, then are you necessarily right and am I necessarily wrong? If I have beaten you instead of your beating me, then am I necessarily right and are you necessarily wrong? Is one of us right and the other wrong? Are both of us right or are both of us wrong? If you and I don't know the answer, then other people are bound to be even more in the dark. Whom shall we get to decide what is right? Shall we get someone who agrees with you to decide? But if he already agrees with you, how can he decide fairly? Shall we get someone who agrees with me? But if he already agrees with me, how can he decide? Shall we get someone who disagrees with both of us? But if he already disagrees with both of us, how can he decide? Shall we get someone who agrees with both of us? But if he already agrees with both of us, how can he decide? Obviously, then, neither you nor I nor anyone else can decide for each other. Shall we wait for still another person? But waiting for one shifting voice [to pass judgment on] another is the same as waiting for none of them. Harmonize them all with the Heavenly Equality, leave them to their endless changes, and so live out your years. What do I mean by harmonizing them with the Heavenly Equality? Right is not right; so is not so. If right were really right, it would differ so clearly from not right that there would be no need for argument. If so were really so, it would differ so clearly from not so that there would be no need for argument. Forget the years; forget distinctions.

The simplest thing to do is just to mind your own business and enjoy what you love.\u00a0\nSo\n what\n if people have \u201cshitty\u201d opinions or don\u2019t agree with yours? Even if they have arguably horrendous opinions that can be taken as harmful and legitimately wrong in so many ways? No one is arguing about how terrible that is. No one is pointing out anyone being wrong about facts. Because from what I\u2019ve seen, this information could be taken as fact.\u00a0\nI don\u2019t know this person, though. No matter how many posts I could possibly read, \nI do not know this person\n.\u00a0\nAgain, so what, if these people share the same site as you? Participate in the same fandom as you and, dare I say, \nhave their own opinions\n?\nThey exist in every. Single. Situation. Fandom or not. It\u2019s life.\u00a0\nI just fail to comprehend how we can\u2019t just ignore them if it bothers us.\nThe only person you can control 100% is \nyou\n.\u00a0\nThe thing that mostly rubs me the wrong way with this is how astoundingly hypocritical we all look as a community when instead of just enjoying what we love and ignoring the inevitable toxic people who are going to be there, we point them out and \nactually invite others to potentially attack them\n? Even if that\u2019s not the intent, that is what will happen.\u00a0\nGuys. We\u2019re \nbetter\n than this.\u00a0\nPerhaps \nI\u2019m\n being hypocritical by stating an opinion at all (considering instead of ignoring the potential discourse I\u2019m saying something), and that\u2019s a point that can definitely be made. I acknowledge that.\u00a0\nThe main reason I\u2019m saying something at all is because this affects my community and creates drama that didn\u2019t have to be there. Of course I can make the choice to leave, which I very well could. And might.\nHowever, I do believe that people who want to bring attention to toxic participants in fandoms are coming from a good place, and I respect them as people regardless of context. On top of that, it\u2019s obvious that when this comes about, usually it\u2019s coming from a place where these people want what\u2019s best for everyone.\u00a0\nBut calling people out and subjecting them to potential slander, even if these people are just as bad as you claim them to be, is... completely pointing everything back at you. It\u2019s unbecoming, and unfortunately can make you look like the attacker, and not someone trying to bring\u00a0\u201cawareness.\u201d\n... Maybe I\u2019m wrong, or painfully naive. But I stand by this. The only thing that keeps making this fandom toxic is the constant back and forth on\u00a0\u201cwho should be held accountable\u201d and people who think they\u2019ve been appointed as fandom police.\u00a0\nI fear for how this will blow up.\u00a0\nPlease, let\u2019s try to stick together through this and not attack each other. Just do your own thing. Live and love and do.\nIf this does end up blowing out of proportion, I\u2019m not going to be around for it.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "cybrtrawn-remade", "id": 154442652306, "date": "2016-12-14 00:47:26 GMT", "timestamp": 1481676446, "tags": ["discourse", "lawrence.txt"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z53xii2FrVzgI", "note_count": 1, "body": "anyway since theyre allowed to say \"i hate trans gay men\"\nhere i am. i hate cis gay men."}, {"blog_name": "matblack7", "id": 162942066419, "date": "2017-07-13 15:32:12 GMT", "timestamp": 1499959932, "tags": ["vent", "positive", "discourse", "i guess", "i don't really like that word", "still though", "you guys rock"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZQWfCk2Nm6fxp", "note_count": 1, "body": "Everyone just wants to fight and shit and I mean.\nIs nobody down for being chill and hanging out despite different opinions?"}, {"blog_name": "diddlefib", "id": 646479408547430400, "date": "2021-03-23 20:20:08 GMT", "timestamp": 1616530808, "tags": ["discourse", "agere", "ik this is minor and labelling my hs hardly matters but I just thought it was kinda interesting"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZRqOeTZumPZD4m00", "note_count": 3, "body": "God, trying to pin down where I regress to is really fuckin weird, bc like, the features of my headspace range from \u201cbottles/diapers\u201c to \u201colder kids\u2019 cartoons (read: \nScooby-Doo\n and \nCourage\n) bc younger kids\u2019 shows are too simplistic\u201d to\u00a0\u201cNorrell (and literally nothing else)\u201c\u00a0\nHell, I dropped for a sec in math class today bc we\u2019re covering polynomial division and it absolutely \nyote \nmemories of doing long division in 4th grade to the forefront of my mind.\n\n I\u2019d almost think I just have a large range, but \nthey\u2019re usually concurrent\n, (ex.

could be read as hypermasculine. \u00a0It's interesting to encounter this different perspective.\nI do think a lot of these ideas you're positing (like \"why Kylo did this\" or \"what he felt when\") lean on your own personal intepretations, which I would challenge. \u00a0I would also challenge some of your reasoning perceiving Kylo and Anakin as masculine-coded, like for example:\n\"they are terrified of their own fears\"\nI would say that everyone is, by definition, terrified of their fears. \u00a0Do you mean that they are scared of being afraid? \u00a0Or of expressing fear? \u00a0I would disagree, since, from what I understand, the Dark Side is about embracing fear and using it to access the Force. \u00a0\"Fear is the path to the Dark Side\" and \"use your aggressive feelings\" and etc. \u00a0I think Kylo has trouble acting on his fear and channeling it into his actions because of his call to the Light. \u00a0The Light Side draws on a sense of harmony, so that entropy may be blocking his ability to think about his foes (like Han Solo, or Rey) as a threat.\n\"they are afraid love makes them weak\"\nDo you have an example of this in the films? \u00a0I always thought the Jedi were the ones against attachment.\n\"they are HIGHLY empathic...\"\nThis is true but I don't read it as a traditionally masculine quality.\n\"they are severed from families, they are isolated, and they have been taught that the power within them is volatile\"\nI want to recommend to you \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" by Charlotte Perkins Gillman. \u00a0What you're describing is the exact criteria of conservative, victorian femininity.\n\"their trauma is handed back to them and they are told to bury it\"\nI don't personally associate trauma and repression with the masculine more than the feminine. \u00a0This is something male and female characters have both (historically) experienced. \u00a0I'm thinking of Medea, and other Greek tragic heroines, and maybe Ophelia. \u00a0Yeah, I think the thing is that men and women are both told to bury their emotions, but women are usually portrayed as being unsuccessful at it. \u00a0Like Anakin and Kylo.\nI disagree strongly with your interpretation on what's going through Kylo's head when he kills his father. \u00a0I\u2019m curious, what makes you think it's his goal to be \"rational and objective?\" \u00a0I think he wants to be angry. \u00a0I think is trying to get angry enough to kill his father, but is unable to, because he is too connected to \"the Light\" (harmony, calm, etc).\nI would also disagree about Kylo's lightsaber style. \u00a0I'd say it's a graceful style, and while it does lean heavily on height, speed and power, he also frequently draws on defensive forms to counter offensive and aggressive attacks. \nI can see how you might read the mask as performance of masculinity, given how it makes Kylo's voice deeper. \u00a0When he takes it off, he has a soft, quiet, feminine tone. \u00a0I think what he is attempting to perform with the mask has more to do with Death Magic (the mask is a skull, a symbol for death or monstrosity). \u00a0It's a kind of spell. \u00a0So yeah, I see it as a dark witch thing. \u00a0I think the\u00a0\u201cbig and hulking\u201d aspect is a connection to this as well: a performance of a monster qualities and not necessarily something gendered (unless you\u2019re really reading TFA as a straight-played\u00a0\nBeauty and the Beast, Hades/Persephone\n story which...I\u2019m not.) \u00a0I\u2019d also point out that \nthe etymology of the word \u201chulking\u201d refers to the hull of a ship, an object which is overwhelmingly gendered as female.\nI\u2019m glad to know that the Dark Side is constructed with more masculine qualities in other materials like \nThe Clone Wars\n and the EU. \u00a0I can definitely see this being the case, since the stories that revolve around war encourage characters that pride themselves on brute strength and battle-readiness. \u00a0I\u2019m about halfway through the Darth Plaugeis novel, which definitely seems to construct the Dark Side with qualities like deception, courtliness, and cunning more than strength. \u00a0I\u2019m sure this is something that varies a lot across canon.\nOn a different note I do agree that there is a more intriguing and delightful narrative potential for Finnrey than for any other monoamorous heteroromantic pairing involving Rey. \u00a0I was only saying that she's romantically unattached during the course of TFA, and that this is an exciting, progressive choice. \u00a0I\u2019ll also be very excited if she gets together with Finn tbh.\nAnyway, thank you for your thoughts on this. \u00a0I hope this explains my perspective a little better. \u00a0I appreciate hearing from someone with a different interpretation of the character."}, {"blog_name": "rey-is-ace-rey-is-aro", "id": 143521998131, "date": "2016-04-28 07:09:35 GMT", "timestamp": 1461827375, "tags": ["reylo",

I just want to live without constant\noverload, okay?\nLets go a bit more into detail: I\u2019m very clearly\npro self-dx, but I will not take someone seriously who takes one test\nand reads one blog post and then decides \u201cI\u2019m autistic.\u201d That\u2019s\nnot how this works. \nSelf-dx means hours upon hours of reading\nblogs, of reading articles, of checking the criteria again and again\n(cynically said, you're checking off a list, we'll get to that again\nlater on), of asking autistics about every tiny trait you suspect\ncould point towards or against it, of self doubt, of hope, of finding\nautistics spreading positivity or Autism Speaks / Autism Moms(TM)\ntelling you you\u2019re a monster. It\u2019s emotionally draining as fuck.\nSelf-dx is a search for identity. It\u2019s trying to find out why your\nlife is the way it is, why you are a certain way and how to cope with\nproblems in a way that doesn\u2019t do any more damage. \n\nThis line of thought goes in hand with another tumblr thing: Many\npeople shit on self-dx because there's this nearly immortal\nassumption that people self-dx because it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d to be\nmentally ill. It\u2019s not. \nAdmittedly, teenagers are fucking weird\nand maybe some genuinely think they are ill when they are not, but\nI'm convinced that is the minority at best. Also, when we get to the\npoint of preteneding to be sick that\u2019s a legitimate disorder in\nitself. (M\u00fcnchhausen or imposter\u2019s syndrome. I've heard it called\npathological lying, but that's quite a bit different and \nalso \na\ndisorder that people \ncannot control and need help for.\n)\n\nLet's look at a few statistics. In Europe 30% of people are\nofficially diagnosed with a disorder under the ICD-10 / DSM-V. 75% of\nmental disorders start in adolescence (according to a German survey,\nBGS 98; here's also a link to the offical WHO page with statistics: \nHERE\n). The survey does not include those who are too ashamed to get help, who have\nno access to help, who are just not taken serious or have to fear\nabuse if it becomes known. \nAutism is not a mental disorder,\nobviously, but the staggering majority of autistics in the past was\ndiagnosed as a child and face many of the same problems. (I\u2019ll get\nto why the diagnosis age is a problem for autistic people in general\nin a second.) \nNow imagine finding a community of people who\nunderstand you, who can give you actually helpful tips, and you don\u2019t\nhave to reveal your identity. Anything classified as abnormal is\nstill a taboo. People don\u2019t believe you or make jokes about you.\nExample: I had to fight for an autism diagnosis because my dad, and I\nquote, says \u201cthere is nothing wrong with you\u201d. No, there\u2019s not,\nbut I\u2019m still autistic. That\u2019s the mindset people apply to any\nneurodivergence. \nAs to the matter of why so many people on the\ninternet claim to be neurodivergent / mentally ill, I have a theory\nof my own. I can\u2019t prove it, but it makes sense for me. Many\nneurodivergencies make it hard to go out. I\u2019m introverted as hell,\nand often don't have the spoons to go out. So what do I do? I spend\nmy life at home, browsing the internet. It takes me so much less\neffort to keep contact with people than if I had to go out and meet\nthem. No sensory overload, nothing unexpected will happen. Meanwhile,\nthe healthy people and extroverts are out and about having fun their\nown way. And, coming back to the community, on here it\u2019s a lot\neasier to express your thoughts, especially on taboo topics. \nExample:\n I think reading this text we can agree that my\nEnglish (my second language) is reasonably good and that I\u2019m a\nlogical, intelligent person that can express arguments in an ordered\nmanner. Right? Well, if you would be talking to me face to face, I\nwould probably not make a whole lot of sense. I stutter, I lose\ntrains of thoughts, I fall over my vocabulary, my pronunciation is\noften wobbly and then I will inevitably panic and make even less\nsense (this goes for talking in my L1 as well, in case anyone\nwonders). I\u2019m not dumb, but face to face communication is hard. \n\nNext up, the issue with psychologists and getting diagnosed.\n\nThere is this pervasive notion that pschologists are The\nAuthority (TM) who know everything and nobody else can be as good as\nthem.\nHere's the thing: \nPsychologists are human. They\u2019re\nnot omniscient.\nAnd sometimes those psychologists are just shit.\nThey can be sexist, and racist, and narcissistic. They can be\ncondescending, and unable to admit they doN't know enough about a\ntopic, and flat out ignore new evidence because it doesn\u2019t fit\ntheir worldview.\nGo in the actuallyautistic tag. The amount of\npeople who are dismissed by their therapists because this so called\nprofessional \u201chas a feeling\u201d they\u2019re not autistic is\nridiculous. \nFeelings don\u2019t matter.\n Only the diagnostic\ninterview matters, but the patients are denied that because a\npsychologist trusts his gut more than science. Without a decent\nself-dx it will be pretty hard to get diagnosed as a teenager or\nadult. On top of that, once you have learned to pass, autistic traits\nget lost or suppressed for fear of punishment. Often you have to\nconvince them to test you with a detailed list that describes how you\nfit the DSM criteria. Which is by definition already a self-dx.\n\"Oh, but psychologist are trained for that, surely they\nknow!!!!!11!\"\nI\u2019m a psychology student. I just got an A in\nmy clinical psychology class. I'll write my thesis in clinical\npsychology probably. The amount of diagnoses you have to learn does\nnot allow to go in depth of anything. What a psychologist does is\nlisten to you and check boxes on a list. (Sound familiar? I said we'd\nget there again.) We didn't even talk about autism. I did a\npresentation on it, found out my course teacher doesn't even know ABA\nis harmful (his point was \"well the literature says it's\neffective\"; Are You Kidding?). Our paedagogy prof spewed some\nableist phrases pitying her friend that has an autistic kid. The\nperks of being an undercover autistic person :))) (That's sarcasm.)\nTo get back to the point: An ableist at worst, at best uneducated\npsychologist decides if you\u2019re autistic, solely on what they have\nbeen told. The amount of posts that goes \"I was denied diagnosis\nbecause I have good grades / are a girl / have friends / can talk\"\nis ridiculous. \nExample:\n I was in therapy three times until\nI was fifteen and NONE of them got the idea I might be autistic,\ndespite me showing pretty severe symptoms. I had to self-dx and then\nconvince my therapist to test me. I only even got that idea because\nwe watched Rain Man in school. Seriously?\nWho knows you better:\nYou or a psychologist you know for an hour? \n\n\nOkay, before I get carried off, all of that assumes you actually\nget as far as being tested. \nTo get there, it requires parents to\nlisten to their kid. Parents typically don\u2019t want anything to be\nwrong with their kid. (There\u2019s nothing wrong with being autistic,\nbut too many people still think that.)\nExample:\n My dad\nstill doesn\u2019t believe I\u2019m autistic. My diagnosis was four years\nago. Because, I quote, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\u201d No\nthere\u2019s not, but that doesn\u2019t make me allistic.\nThe amount of\nstereotypes and ableist myths is staggering. Autism is one of the\nmost misunderstood conditions I\u2019ve ever researched. \nThe DSM\ncriteria are shit. They are, since decades, based on boys. They\u2019re\nvery limited, and while not wrong, describe things in a way that\nmakes it hard for people to find \"atypical\" examples\n(stereotypical interests = trains). What about girls obsessed with\nhorses? Nobody thinks that\u2019s abnormal, yet it\u2019s very possible.\n\nThere are still a ton of people who think girls cannot be\nautistic, or if they are, to use the ableist principles this idea is\nfounded on, they have to be \u201clow-functioning\u201d. The truth is, even\nthe diagnostic interviews can\u2019t pick up on autistic girls very\nwell, that is a known fact. (Look at this link for example:\n\nHERE\n)\nI have most of those posts tagged either as info or ableism, but\nI don't have the spoons to check right now and my internet is shit.)\n\nTo paraphrase the article and the other sources I know: Most\nautistic females just fly under the radar because they\u2019re better at\nadapting and hiding it. That doesn\u2019t have to be a conscious effort,\nbut it\u2019s exhausting, and then you sit there as a teenager and\nwonder why you\u2019re feeling like shit because you never learned\nhealthy autistic coping machanisms (or got punished for\nthem).\nExample:\n I didn\u2019t learn of stimming, of dyspraxia,\nof sensory processing issue and literally everything that had defined\nmy daily life until I found the autsitic community. I don\u2019t think\nmy therapist ever heard of that and I was labeled too\n\u201chigh-functioning\u201d to actually get help. I managed, and back then\nI was fine, or thought I was after the depression wore off. I\u2019m\npaying the price for that now.\nPeople of color and women are\nseverely mis- and underdiagnosed in literally everything medical.\nTeenagers are very rarely taken seriously, especially girls.\nSome\npeople don\u2019t believe autism exists at all. \nNow, assume\nsomebody has understanding parents or teachers or is an adult, and\ncould, thoretically go to a doctor to get diagnosed. Because\n(paraphrasing the original ask here) by validating self-dx we only\npush the notiion that you don't need a doctor to be diagnosed (which\nis again the Autority Lane (TM)).\nWell, yes, it would be preferable to get an official diagnosis, for\nthe accomodations alone, but there is a shitton of reasons not\nto.\nExample: I am currently undiagnosed. How so? My\ntherapist made a deal with my parents that we would not write down\nthe diagnosis, to prevent it from bringing me trouble. At first I was\nlike \u201cthat\u2019s ableist bullshit\u201d. It\u2019s not. Well, it still\ninvolves a lot of ableism, but there are a lot of reasons why I have\nto weigh if getting a diagnosis is worth it, even though I clearly\nneed the help right now. \nHere is a list of good reasons why someone\ncould choose not to get professionally diagnosed:\nmoney (in Germany healthcare is\n\tmostly free, but in the US getting a diagnosis can cost several\n\tthousand dollar)\nautistic people are at a much\n\thigher risk of abuse, and don\u2019t get taken as seriously (see ABA\n\ttherapy and Autism Moms)\nWith an autism diagnosis you can\n\tbe instituationalized far easier against your will (that works with\n\talmost all mental diagnoses)\nIn Germany you will have a harder\n\ttime getting an insurance, they will make you pay more and don\u2019t\n\tprovide certain services\ne.g. You want an insurance for when you\n\tbecome unable to work, you know, like almost everyone has? Yeah,\n\tforget about it, autistic people don\u2019t get that.\nIt can be used against you when\n\tyou get in a fight about your kids\u2019 custody\nMedical ableism is a thing. You\n\tcan have everything from a cold to cancer, from depression to\n\tborderline, it\u2019s all The Autism. Autistic people are often seen as\n\tnot having enough insight into their own body and mind to judge\n\ttheir own body (just like women, so as an autistic woman you're\n\tfucked twice as much :))) )\nGetting a job outside of\n\t\u201csupportive\u201d businesses (read: they want Rain Man. They\u2019re IT\n\tbusinesses who want autistic programmers and engineers, everyone\n\telse is pretty much fucked.) will be almost impossible. Autism is a\n\tdisability and nobody wants disabled people past what the necessary\n\tquota is. \n\t\nIn the psych field there are no\n\tofficially diagnosed people I know of, one researcher\u2019s work was\n\tdiscredited when it came out she was autistic. I was already warned\n\tseveral times that I should hide my autism if I wanted to get a job\n\tat all.\nbasically, people are shit and can and will use your\n\tdiagnosis against you\nLastly, I don\u2019t really understand why people are so hateful\ntowards the self-dx crowd. I can\u2019t prove that there\u2019s no black\nsheep, but most of them are people who look to improve their lives\nand better their mental health. Let\u2019s put it like this:\nThe anti-self dx crowd: Only psychologists can tell if you\u2019re\nautistic.\nSelf-dx: I think I\u2019m autistic.\nAntis: How dare you!\nI can clearly tell you\u2019re not autistic. Fuck off, faker.\nCall me cynic, but that is the core of reason most anti-self-dxers\napply. Who the hell gave \nthem\n the authority to judge other\npeople? How do you know what a person is going through from reading\ntwo posts on tumblr?\nThis isn\u2019t some elite club. That kind of\nthinking ostracizes us even more when we alread have to fight so hard\nto be allwoed to live. \nWho are the self-dxers hurting? The\nableists treat us like shit anyway.\nAnd honestly? I\u2019d rather let\nin five fakers than have an autistic person suffer alone because of\nthey can\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d they\u2019re autistic.\nDev out."}, {"blog_name": "betweenheroesandvillains", "id": 137953955274, "date": "2016-01-24 16:06:35 GMT", "timestamp": 1453651595, "tags": ["auditions", "auditioning", "chekov", "discourse", "are they nuts?", "what am i supposed to write???"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZzaMpo20UiatA", "note_count": 0, "body": "for my next audition they expect me to write 2 to 4 pages about a tchekov role i have to learn... like. what?"}, {"blog_name": "classically-abby", "id": 671106876254076928, "date": "2021-12-20 16:23:11 GMT", "timestamp": 1640017391, "tags": ["classically abby", "discourse", "classically abby vtuber project", "covid 19", "disney queen", "the times of india: latest news india", "traditional femininity", "tradwife", "classy", "tradfem"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZhjoDUbGG2NrSa00", "note_count": 36, "body": "Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"blog_name": "emo-and-dumb", "id": 176960452217, "date": "2018-08-13 19:47:56 GMT", "timestamp": 1534189676, "tags": ["transmed", "debate", "discourse", "truscum", "this is going to be fun", "hell yes", "im excited", "anti nb", "mogai", "mogai discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZisB4Z2apgZPv", "note_count": 43, "body": "There is a genderfluid and pansexual person in my class\nThey heard that im  transmed we talked for a while and we are going to have a debate later, is going to be fun and im excited, i have always wanted to have a debate out of the internet but tucutes are kinda rare to find here(witch is kinda okay tbh) so yeah, im excited, wish me luck! \u2665\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "ahoylovers", "id": 177192375176, "date": "2018-08-20 06:41:13 GMT", "timestamp": 1534747273, "tags": ["UGH I HATE THIS", "discourse", "Audra Phillips", "Bill Denbrough", "Eddie\u2019s Death Scene", "like literally guys come off your high horse and realize that we have the benefit of a clear mind and NOT ACTUALLY BEING PUT IN THIS SITUAT", "like we\u2019re operating IN FUCKING THEORY", "goodbye I\u2019m done with you"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZRi0Ka2b1VHE8", "note_count": 3, "body": "oh yes bill was so selfish for SAVING HIS WIFE HOW UNFORGIVABLE y\u2019all really don\u2019t understand how pissed I am about this "}, {"blog_name": "cryptide-travis", "id": 167738844900, "date": "2017-11-21 17:24:51 GMT", "timestamp": 1511285091, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZoDZef2SE0wRa", "note_count": 0, "body": "I love online discourse also,\nThe wood we build with is domesticated trees\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "therocketbee", "id": 157677996065, "date": "2017-02-25 04:25:09 GMT", "timestamp": 1487996709, "tags": ["rocket's random thoughts", "discourse", "chips"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZlFXCl2IsLqWX", "note_count": 0, "body": "Discourse\u2122 \noven baked chips are better"}, {"blog_name": "the-skies-are-cloudy", "id": 653830197611806720, "date": "2021-06-12 23:37:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1623541066, "tags": ["dsmp", "discourse", "dream smp", "twitter", "i fucking hate twitter", "burn it", "kill it"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZRMXRZaItnd04q00", "note_count": 15, "body": "I freaking hate twitter so much, I myself am not a content creator and I go to therapy.

It\u2019s not that it\u2019s hard to understand - it\u2019s that people have their own definitions based on their own ideology.\nMaybe I\u2019ve just been cursed to see enough discourse to know how different factions think and act, but I think when you analyse a person and their overall stance, you can figure out what they mean when they say certain things.\nAnd I mean, even \u201cI don\u2019t understand what this means nobody makes sense\u201d in itself tends to show an ideological stance, it\u2019s basically the fandom discourse version of centrism, and often carries the same smug obnoxiousness of being \u201cabove\u201d everything.\nTo put it another way, it\u2019s basically just like online political discourse. Everyone has their own ideologies and in-groups. I don\u2019t see the level of eyerolling at that though, like it IS there with stuff like factional infighting, but I think because it\u2019s fandom and less \u201cserious\u201d people look down on it and it looks silly, even though real people are being hurt by this drama and discourse.\nAlso yeah that\u2019s another thing: I hate how what I will call \u201cfandom centrists\u201d based on what I describe above act about this stuff, like it\u2019s all just petty drama. Trust me, I hate it, and it makes me really uncomfortable to hear about to the point I think it\u2019s an actual trigger for me, but harassment, death threats, etc are a real issue and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.\nIt should be clear I\u2019m hardly unbiased, either. I have my own understanding of what these terms mean based on my own experiences and what I make of fandom. I also mentioned that I find fandom discourse distressing to the point I think it\u2019s an actual trigger for me. Exceptions are there when it comes to people I feel I can trust to be fully honest on the subject and understand my own boundaries, but for most people, even people I consider friends, it\u2019s really distressing to see.\nI guess I bring this up because I feel like the use of some terms personally does rub me the wrong way? Like I said, I have my own biases, but it still feels like I\u2019m seeing words misconstrued for the sake of fitting a narrative, usually to attack people and what they may believe.\nI really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying with this, I really just find this subject super stressful and it\u2019s hard to even feel comfortable in modern fandoms anymore with this level of drama and discourse. If I feel I could be fully honest without feeling dragged into discourse myself, I would.

(currently, both catra and adora don\u2019t understand each other nor even themselves well enough to be together yet.) in addition, based on season 1, at least, due to many visual cues (like a bi flag color scheme in the background of almost every catra-adora scene), as well as seeds planted in the plot, i genuinely believe that catradora will most likely be the endgame of the show. so while i will reblog and create \nfanon\n\u00a0content for the ship, as i see immense potential in their relationship and i enjoy the enemies to friends to lovers route their relationship seems to be taking, i do not think season-1-finale catra or season-1-adora should be together. and in the words of \n@nepptoon\n,\u00a0\u201cit isn\u2019t about shipping an angsty abusive ship, it\u2019s about wanting them to find each other again without the toxic influence of the horde.\u201d and that\u2019s exactly it\u2013the reason i ship them is because i see potential in their relationship and really want to see how they grow and develop as characters and how they grow and develop together, not because i think catra almost intentionally killing adora is uwu hot n cute haha.\nbasically: if you believe that the relationship between catra and adora right now, at the end of season 1, is cute or romantic, unfollow me. if you see that while the plot planted seeds for catra and adora to potentially get together, there is still a lot of room for catra and adora to grow both individually and in their understanding of each other and u know. fully detach themselves from the horde. before they can actually pursue each other as romantic interests, then like. same.\u00a0\nand yes, catra will have to go through more growth, but that\u2019s because of her upbringing. and while this doesn\u2019t excuse her actions, it\u2019s impt to understand why catra is taking so long to come around to the good side.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "zolfjkimbley", "id": 175615148258, "date": "2018-07-06 18:57:33 GMT", "timestamp": 1530903453, "tags": ["discourse", "moira", "why is this still an argument"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZzjFtd2ZZUe3Y", "note_count": 0, "body": "\u201cthere\u2019s no way moira can be a lesbian! she has sharp nails!\u201d\nlisten, i don\u2019t know if you knew this or not, but... mouths, toys, and strap-ons exist. wlw use more than just their fingers when they\u2019re fucking.\nalso, she probably takes her nails off before she does the deed.\n...or maybe she\u2019s just a pillow princess. lord only knows."}, {"blog_name": "shoujoboy-restart", "id": 671617181185933312, "date": "2021-12-26 07:34:16 GMT", "timestamp": 1640504056, "tags": ["history", "discourse", "a statue of a fictional character and the one of a slave owner are conceptually the same thing and you can't convince me otherwise"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zn4BeTbI44ILem00", "note_count": 0, "body": "I'm sorry but if your argument as to why statues of slave owners and other historical degenerates being torn down is bad is \"no! if you destroy the artistic equivalent of a sponsored #ad Instagram photo with filters no one will ever learn history ever again!\" i hope those statues get melted down into baseball bats and you get you kneecaps smashed with those, like holy shit my duderinos there are dozens of better arguments and solutions than that weak baby's first high school philosophy class debate headass, be better use your brain for extra minute please.\nAnd this is coming from somebody who think they should be rounded up and put in a museum were actual context for the historical background for them is provided."}, {"blog_name": "eorzean-capitalist", "id": 167499976759, "date": "2017-11-14 23:43:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1510703026, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZsVOmv2R-nj0t", "note_count": 11, "body": "Whataboutism.\nThe moment you see someone posting something you take personally, and decide to counter with\u00a0\u2018But what about (insert thing here)!\u2019\nIt\u2019s derailing the original point, and you should feel bad for attempting this tactic."}, {"blog_name": "stop-and-smell-the-rose-quartz", "id": 148482811173, "date": "2016-08-05 05:22:48 GMT", "timestamp": 1470374568, "tags": ["su spoilers", "bismuth", "steven universe", "might delete later", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zfgici2AIG_Kb", "note_count": 11, "body": "Bismuth Thoughts\nGod, the Bismuth tag is such a mess and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to dip my fucking toe in here but HERE WE GO.\n\u201cOh my god, Rose is so awful for not telling the other gems the truth about Bismuth!\u201d Okay, but...given everything we have seen about Rose and have been told about Rose, I highly doubt it was done to spite Bismuth.

I can think of people who disagree with standard social democratic regulatory left ideas for compassionate reasons- I\u2019d be one for some of the ideas- but it takes a lot of careful advocacy to get anyone to accept that no-seriously-the-reason-this-person-disagrees-isn\u2019t-that-they-secretly-don\u2019t-care, of the kind I\u2019d normally make cautiously, one on one. And this got me thinking.\nI don\u2019t think liberals who believe their enemies just don\u2019t care about people are monsters. I used to be one. When I arrived in the rationalist community, many years ago, my reaction to \u201csome people honestly believe libertarian ideas are the best\u201d was \u201cif they read that strongly into the weak evidence it\u2019s because they already wanted to believe it, and wanted to believe it more than they cared about people\u201d. It took a lot of exposure to people within the community over the years who really did care, and had good and on some points \nactually convincing\n arguments of the sort which are too good and too felt to be rationalisation, to change that.\nSome of it is because it serves people to believe their enemies are uncaring; this could well explain the assholes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to explain how otherwise nice people think this way. More of it is, I think, a lack of appreciation for the breadth and depth of mindspace. If you\u2019re implicitly \nleft-sceptical\n and around people who are left-sceptical pretty much exclusively, and have never encountered the term, as far as you\u2019re concerned left-scepticism is just \nhow humans work\n\u00a0when it comes to helping others. If all the arguments pro and con the predictive power of economics that you\u2019ve ever encountered have been pretty weak, you\u2019re not going to understand how it could be a true keystone for beliefs, as opposed to an argument as weapon.\nSome of it is that most people don\u2019t get the benefit of encountering intelligent, thoughtful, and genuinely felt arguments. Even if you seek them out, outside the rationalist community, maybe ~90% of the arguments you encounter for, say, libertarianism, which claim to be on care/harm grounds are actually very shoddy arguments constructed by people who actually arrived at their position via liberty foundation grounds or even spite-based grounds (spite being the world\u2019s number one moral foundation). The typical human, feeling like they were being virtuous in trying to expand their horizons in the first place, will encounter this a few times, then get tired of checking and assume they\u2019re all like that, and have everyone else around them readily confirm that they did the same and got the same results. The typical dishonesty of political discourse serves only to confirm everyone\u2019s worst impressions of everyone else.\nAnd outside of higher brow libertarians (who are remarkably chill), there are few places a person broadly construed as a liberal can go to read dissenting views and not read a torrent of abuse as the first, middle, and last things they encounter. If you go read communist or anarchist or the more \u201creeeeeee\u201d kind of libertarian thinking, about 80% of their contemporary talk is analysis of how every liberal is personally evil. The typical human, even making a sincere effort, will be distracted by this, and when the argument isn\u2019t convincing anyway, will remember it as a reason why their enemies are not reasonable and not worth trying again.\nI think the people are mostly well intentioned, but the combination of these things maintains the bubble, and confirms that the people outside the bubble are jerks who don\u2019t care about human suffering every time they look outside of it.\nA lot of these probably also explains bubbles elsewhere in the political spectrum. I\u2019m not close enough to comment directly, though.\nI called this\u00a0\u201cOn Breaking Liberal Bubbles\u201d, so I suppose I need to try to conclude with some practical ideas.\nProbably the most novel conclusion would be the idea that maybe the first priority in persuading people should be to explain the breadth of mindspace directly, before any arguments relating to the substance at all. Introduce the concept of left-scepticism and contrast to right-scepticism and... free-scepticism or whatever you want to call the position that unless overruled by strong evidence we should let people be as free as possible. Make a case- it is not a hard case to make- that these ideas are heuristics people could genuinely believe help people the most. If a grasp of the breadth of mindspace got widespread, maybe communication would work better.\nAnother might be to try to find, or write, arguments we can link which are... I want to say \u201cnot littered with spite towards liberals\u201d, but genuine \u201cI\u2019m so pissed off that misguided regulations are hurting people in all these ways\u201d writing is actually pretty compelling. I guess\u00a0\u201cwhich doesn\u2019t make unexplained random digs every few paragraphs\u201d, and especially which doesn\u2019t have unexplained mockery of them for supporting things they support, because by default this parses as mockery of trying to help people.\nA third might just be to say that you\u2019ve encountered people who don\u2019t agree with you who are genuinely trying, when you\u2019ve gotten away from the world of thinkpieces, even if they\u2019re hard to find and most arguments are really awful and a lot of people are centred on different values than helping people. Just a datapoint to counteract all the peer reinforcement.\nBut probably ultimately we would want some kind of cross-political-perspective collection of compassionate, truly believed by their authors, arguments for all kinds of positions that could be used as a proof by existence: If you want to get outside your bubble and find arguments from other people who want to help people but don\u2019t agree with you, this is where to look. And I don\u2019t think we have one."}, {"blog_name": "ourwitching", "id": 170846672755, "date": "2018-02-13 21:48:18 GMT", "timestamp": 1518558498, "tags": ["merpeople", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZwUAkl2V7GLTp", "note_count": 1, "body": "Controversial Opinion\nArtists draw mermaids because they don\u2019t know how to draw feet"}, {"blog_name": "kekeslider", "id": 175803319931, "date": "2018-07-12 04:45:57 GMT", "timestamp": 1531370757, "tags": ["discourse", "im gonna stop now i just", "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh no more discourse around here for a while someone show me some soft sweet lances"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZFGLca2ZkiSPx", "note_count": 17, "body": "I don\u2019t know what the opposite of a power move would be called, but sha///adins claiming their ship isn\u2019t pedophilia and then posting a fic with it tagged as Underage Sex is definitely it"}, {"blog_name": "dappy-dappernette", "id": 655647084950716416, "date": "2021-07-03 00:56:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1625273785, "tags": ["hetalia", "discourse", "hetalia discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZOTwzhaPKupCWW00", "note_count": 11, "body": "Ngl I ship Gerita, but everytime I see a certain bitch I just remember why it's both one of my biggest NOTPs while also being one of my biggest OTPs and why I actually physically feel extremely uncomfortable around it.

I have a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Psychology and obviously have a vested interest in the field. In addition to this I am neurodivergent and have suffered with anxiety, panic, depression, and bipolar for my entire life. I have also had the misfortune of experiencing the mental hospital setting first hand.\nSo first, the good news!\nRecently on tumblr I have noticed a growing presence of support groups for mental health issues or, at the very least, posts going around supporting individuals experiencing one disorder or another. This is \ngreat\n, because it means that as a group we are working to reduce stigma and increase communication. This also means that there is a higher chance for self-advocacy and self-diagnosis, which can drastically improve the lives of those suffering with mental illness.\nImportant Note:\n Self-diagnosis is not an actual substitute for a clinical diagnosis. Bringing in a suggestion to a psychologist is a great start and may help get you on the track to the right therapies and medications straight away. This said, diagnosis is a hairy situation and the DSM is changing rapidly. This means criteria for each disorder are being modified and that disorders themselves are being renamed and reclassified. Diagnosis is a challenge even for trained professionals - try not to jump the gun and wait for an official diagnosis before declaring a certain disorder. It is better to say that you\u00a0\u201cmay have depression\u201d than you\u00a0\u201cdo have depression\u201d and run the risk of misrepresenting a group of people. If others treat you as less legitimate for this, that\u2019s their problem - better to be cautious and right than disrespectful and wrong.\nObviously, there are some downsides to disseminating mental health information online, chiefly that misinformation can spread and that the material may be handled poorly or incorrectly. This is not to say that I am condemning using social media as a platform for education and awareness - I \nam\n\u00a0a millennial, after all. What I \nam\n\u00a0saying is that it is our responsibility as those circulating information and advice to make sure that it is non-damaging.\nMostly, I am talking about posts that clarify what a mental disorder is versus what an abuser is.\nHere\u2019s the thing: there is a difference between the two. The other? They can co-occur whether we want them to or not. This is something we need to be \nincredibly mindful of\n\u00a0when discussing mental health.\nFirst and foremost let\u2019s clarify: having a mental disorder does not make you a bad person. It does not mean something is inherently wrong with you or that you are doomed to a certain set of actions. As humans we are gifted with choice and autonomy, and while mental illness can make it feel like these abilities are lessened, they \nare\n\u00a0within our reach. Always.\nBut\n(Yes, here\u2019s the other shoe)\nHaving a mental disorder means that you have to be more responsible than your neurotypical friends and family. Why? This doesn\u2019t seem fair! Well, it\u2019s not.\nHowever, having a mental disorder means there is a possibility for abusing the attentions and kindnesses of others. This means it is easier - when you\u2019re not feeling at your best - to try and justify more extreme actions, reactions, and emotions on your diagnosis than on yourself and your choices. And that\u2019s \nnot\n\u00a0good.\u00a0\nTaking personal responsibility for how you interact with others is imperative regardless of your mental state. If you hurt someone with your words or actions it is \nstill your responsibility\n\u00a0to apologize or explain yourself.\nIf you are apologizing to the same people for the same reasons again and again \nseek immediate help\n. Hurting people cyclically - even if you apologize every time - is a form of abuse. It is \nyour\u00a0\nresponsibility\n\u00a0to ensure you don\u2019t use your disorder as a shield for bad behavior - educate yourself on what qualifies as different types of abuse and talk with others about ways situations can be handled differently. There are options and there are tons of resources out there!\nSo what does this have to do with tumblr?\nIt means being mindful of the types of posts you spread. While it is good - and extremely validating - to encourage others of the differences between mental disorder and abuse, try \nnot\n\u00a0to reblog the ones that refute that there could ever be crossover. It isn\u2019t pleasant, I admit. It doesn\u2019t look nice and neat. But please, please, \nplease\n\u00a0do not exacerbate the notion that having a mental disorder is like a Get Out Of Jail card for how you interact with others. There ARE people out there who will look at that as validation and justification of their mistreatment of others.\nIn addition, please consider those users who have been mistreated at the hands of such an individual. While it is good to bolster the morale and confidence of those with disorders \ndo not invalidate, deny, or minimize the trauma and abuse of potential victims.\n\u00a0Sharing posts that leave no room for individual differences or the claiming of personal responsibility only leave room for feelings of guilt, doubt, and shame in those that have suffered at the hands of an abuser.\nBottom line:\u00a0\n1. No one is exempt from being an abuser or being abused and it is the aggressor\u2019s duty to claim responsibility for their actions regardless of their mental state.\n2. Blog and reblog responsibly: even the most encouraging post could have the potential to invalidate the experiences of others.\n3. Be respectful and open to new idea and criticism. We\u2019re all just trying our best here."}, {"blog_name": "lancesgalaxy", "id": 168909896877, "date": "2017-12-25 01:48:31 GMT", "timestamp": 1514166511, "tags": ["it just makes me", "so damn uncomfortable", "happy Chrysler everyone", "more junk for my trunk", "discourse", "???

In the economics section, Campbell introduced with a story about\na protest that brought individuals from all different backgrounds and\nethnicities together. Campbell then began to discuss the historical roots of\nglobalization\u2019s effect on economies, explaining the origins of the\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary\nFund, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Campbell then tied in\nneoliberalism and how the neoliberalist movement altered economies worldwide.\nIn the politics section, Campbell argued that politics consist of social\nrelations and that these social relations are affected by the idea of\nmulticulturalism. In the culture section of Campbell\u2019s analysis on the\ndimensions of globalization, Campbell argues that culture is learned through\nboth enculturation and socialization. Campbell also brings up questions\nconcerning cultural identities and peace, asking if one culture can peacefully\ncoexist and interact with another. Then the concept of global citizenship is\nbrought up, backed with two models of citizenship; one saying that an\nindividual is capable of being ruled and of ruling and the other stating that\ncitizenship is a legal status. Stoicism is introduced, which states that\nuniversal understanding is brought upon by self-control, as with cosmopolitanism,\nwhich is a belief that all people are connected. \nIn the second reading, Steger analyzed if globalization is\nnew. Steger talks about each time period and how each civilization affected\nanother, one of the prime examples being major world trade networks. In the\nend, Steger argues that globalization has been around for a long time, perhaps\nas long as civilizations themselves. \nI found the concept of neoliberalism interesting, that\ngovernment control of the economy is corrupted and flawed. While I do agree\nthat total government control is bad and that the government can be corrupt, I\nthink that allowing the privatization of companies can be very dangerous and\ncan negatively affect those who are in an unstable economic or financial\nposition. Also, I found the argument Campbell made about culture and peace very\ninteresting as well. As a Jew living in a Christian-normative society, I have\nfound that the majority are very easily unsettled by those which are different,\nby those which they don\u2019t understand. I find myself agreeing with Benjamin\nBarber in that he advocates for a form of government that aids communities in\nbeing more tolerant. Someone told me once that the way of nature is violence\nand competition and to expect anything or anyone to combat or change that is na\u00efve.\nThis does make sense, as animals fight and eat one another, trees and plants\ncompete for soil, and even bacteria consume other bacteria. As depressing and\nseemingly true as that is, I can\u2019t help but devote my life to trying to combat\nviolence. And now that I\u2019m done my philosophical rambling, I didn\u2019t find Steger\u2019s\nchapter all that interesting or controversial. Steger only confirmed my\nprevious belief that globalization has been around as long as we have. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "alphasord", "id": 148096792853, "date": "2016-07-28 12:34:13 GMT", "timestamp": 1469709253, "tags": ["they speak", "one dollar say this will start some", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZMG5Xo29xGRaL", "note_count": 2, "body": "when u go to the bro tag to find a Good Art tm but all u find is ur Regret and some Need to roleplay ur post game au w/ ur partner so u can have dave yell at bro One More Time "}, {"blog_name": "wentoffiguess", "id": 162808774767, "date": "2017-07-10 03:19:44 GMT", "timestamp": 1499656784, "tags": ["purity politics", "fandom", "discourse", "characterization", "anime", "like what?", "be careful what you ask for"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZP9AZk2NeAC1l", "note_count": 0, "body": "Tumblr I can't believe you made me read that with my own two eyes\nRandom anime discourse post on a problematic pairing in canon, \nwithout a single trace of irony whatsoever\n: \u201c[Character\u2019s] perversion could have been handled in a different way.\u201d"}, {"blog_name": "cenntaur-remaking", "id": 181017186637, "date": "2018-12-11 14:33:34 GMT", "timestamp": 1544538814, "tags": ["kermit.txt", "drama", "discourse", "not about mutuals or followers"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZVCLsY2ebTn5D", "note_count": 9, "body": "look i dont. like getting involved in drama anymore but this is just ridiculous. you cant call out a 13 year old for. crytyping?/ theyre a child and you wanna know how fucking gross i was at 13? i was an awful person. but people taught me better, gave me a chance, and sure im no angel now but im a lot better holy shit"}, {"blog_name": "timedeo", "id": 651742141622747136, "date": "2021-05-20 22:29:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1621549741, "tags": ["just thoughts i guess. i promise this is the last post on the matter", "like if read maybe? idk just kind of. want to see if people are listening", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z2jiMTaBT0PKau00", "note_count": 92, "body": "it\u2019s like.. guys i get it i really do, having a diverse community generalized as racist white dudes is fucking tiring and insulting to minority creators in said community, and i want to fight back against that too, but i feel like you guys are setting yourselves up to fail by picking fights with people who are going to hate you regardless, idk."}, {"blog_name": "cola-losers", "id": 647312115377504256, "date": "2021-04-02 00:55:39 GMT", "timestamp": 1617324939, "tags": ["bleh", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZX4g5WZxjl1tuW00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Imma keep it real with you anon, I have more important things to worry about in life than adult webtoon discourse or webtoon discourse in general\nLike\nHmu when I'm no longer taking a cocktail of pills every morning or when bills stop being a thing"}, {"blog_name": "zestea-zesty", "id": 171139014426, "date": "2018-02-21 21:20:45 GMT", "timestamp": 1519248045, "tags": ["gun control", "discourse", "mass shooting", "zestea talks", "ask to tag"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZxXwRd2VOhXyQ", "note_count": 9, "body": "People are always talking about how they \u201cneed\u201d guns for home defense reasons, but have you considered:\n\n\n\nAn actual home security system\n\nA guard dog\n\nSelf-defense classes\n\nThat shiny new set of kitchen knives you bought but never use, yes you, Barbara-\n\nLiterally anything other than guns\n\n\nSeriously.

(why? because she wants to be queen of the allies, but doesn\u2019t want to actually put any work in.) she chooses to include an actor in the fantastic beasts films who literally physically abused his wife, likes transmisogynistic tweets and retweets transphobic articles, riddles the goblins in her books with antisemitic tropes, riddles the centaurs in her books with native american stereotypes, exploits native american beliefs and is generally incredibly racist on pottermore, uses werewolves to play on the aids crisis, and queercodes her villains (\u201chigh, feminine voice\u201d, anyone?). she writes in a made-up system of oppression which, yep, sure, fab, but deliberately leaves out any and all discussion of how already-existing oppressive shittiness fits into this. instead, she fills her writing with harmful tropes and stereotypes, and does the very bare minimum anyone could ever possibly do to think themselves an ally. \ngotta say, she\u2019s not the best. \u202c\n(to say the best of her, her books are at least kind of available to a more diverse, feminist reading if you\u2019re really trying, but that\u2019s like the best compliment i can come with.) \nit\u2019s chill to still love the books. the books are not HER, and tbh she\u2019s a millionaire anyway, boycotting at this point will do fuck-all. you can love the books, adore the books, study the books, but recognise that the writer is deeply problematic and the things she does are not okay. separate art from artist, and remember that her word is not canon. the texts are canon, and that\u2019s it. the texts suck in a lot of ways, and are great in a lot of ways. that\u2019s how it is. \nas readers, though, what we can do is interpret canon in a BETTER way, in a way that takes what she wrote and improves it\u2014not for her sake, but out of spite of the fact that her writing is a piss-poor attempt at intersectionality, and we as readers refuse to accept it. because we think that the wonderful characters we fell in love with deserve better than her mediocre interpretation. \nshe may have written the weird and wonderful world of harry potter as very white, as very straight, as very cis, as very christian, but as readers, we have so much more power. \nwe can read the characters however we want. and we should. because jk rowling sucks, and the characters are, ultimately, ours, not hers. (death of the author, lads.) \nthe diverse characters you see in the books are much richer and far more enjoyable to read than the endless series of bland, cishet white people she wrote down. \nif you can\u2019t do it, if that\u2019s too much emotional labour for you, then goddamn fair enough, you do you. \nif you want to read a really good book series that explicitly has black characters, trans characters, gay and bi characters, and also loads of awesome magic and worldbuilding (basically, the fascinating world and amazing characters jk rowling set out to write, BUT ACTUALLY DONE RIGHT), read the broken earth trilogy by nk jemisin. or read anything by nk jemisin. those books will stick with you, and you won\u2019t be let down. \nhappy reading, everybody. \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "sarahepburnspam", "id": 176690104275, "date": "2018-08-06 08:36:03 GMT", "timestamp": 1533544563, "tags": ["psa", "wlw positivity", "ace discourse", "discourse", "lgbt discourse", "feminism", "feminist", "feminism discourse", "destroy the patriarchy"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z2c-5Z2aZZGVJ", "note_count": 10, "body": "PSA\nIf your feminism doesn\u2019t include lesbians, and that means trans/nb lesbians, trans/nb women, asexual lesbians, he/him identifying lesbians, disabled lesbians, wlwoc, and bisexual women, then it\u2019s not really feminism. \nit\u2019s just you being selfish \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "astro-b-o-y-d", "id": 174186487416, "date": "2018-05-23 19:35:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1527104128, "tags": ["kuzann", "Negative", "Discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z4XePx2YEKjvu", "note_count": 5, "body": "kuzann\n replied to your \npost\n:\n\n                    Real fucking cowardly of M//a//x//vid shippers to...                \n\n    Also just, not tagging the ship stuff is rude to people who are trying to filter out the ship tags so :/    \nY U P."}, {"blog_name": "rosyr", "id": 175757562910, "date": "2018-07-10 22:05:56 GMT", "timestamp": 1531260356, "tags": ["discourse", "like if ur gonna condone it just admit it", "dont sneak around supporting it", "stand by a conviction at least christ"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z-CJde2ZhzvGU", "note_count": 22, "body": "antis who follow and rb directy from shallie artists just bc they also draw k/ance make me so mad lmfao\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "boglord", "id": 168841465360, "date": "2017-12-23 03:00:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1513998015, "tags": ["lucretia", "taz", "the adventure zone", "discourse", "the director", "lucas miller"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z5zlVd2TFl4uG", "note_count": 335, "body": "My question to the world is: why do people insist that Lucretia did nothing wrong?\u00a0\nI\u2019m not saying I think Lucretia is a villain, or that I dislike Lucretia at all.

I don\u2019t know if people genuinely don\u2019t get that or if they\u2019re just being willfully obtuse because they don\u2019t want to admit their fave is problematic. Humans who hate mutants in the X-Men are still meant to look like homophobes even though LGBT people can\u2019t actually throw cars and shoot lasers from their eyes. The gems in Steven Universe being aliens doesn\u2019t mean their portrayals of sexuality and gender presentation are some bizarre, inscrutably inhuman shit like what you\u2019d see in Futurama. The takeaway from Captain Planet isn\u2019t that people made of toxic waste shouldn\u2019t be given corporate promotions. Fantasy elements aren\u2019t a cue to turn your brain off. And this might come as a surprise, but when a piece of media is pushing an agenda, the creator is trying to make \ntheir\n group look like the good guys. Conservative Christians want you think LGBT people are immoral perverts that hate Jesus. The KKK wants you to think black people are violent criminals that deserve subjugation. Male chauvinists want you to think feminists are delusional man-haters that want to outlaw fun. So on and so on.

As if calling out fascism is more alarming than fascism itself. And \n\nI didn\u2019t say \u201cEren is a nazi because he wants to kill all the titans!\u201d or something similarly as asinine or baseless, I spelled out the plot in a way that anyone who reads it makes the inference. I mean, except for the last sentence about Erwin, but he has the same name as Rommel and his birthday is Rommel\u2019s deathday so it\u2019d be one hell of a coincidence. Pixis is canonically modeled after General Yoshifuru Akiyama, commander of the Korean occupation, whom the author respects and looks up to. This is not speculation, Isayama said this himself. The themes of the series are heavily engendered by and inspired by Japanese Imperalism, even on a fundamental level since that was the last time Japan had a military force. The notion of \u201cfunny-looking humanoid monsters that keep trying to enter our homeland and must be kept out\u201d 100% has connotations towards Japan\u2019s treatment of Koreans and other peoples they conquered. And the same goes for all the German-inspired elements since Japan\u2019s views on Germany are intrinsically tied to the nations\u2019 relationship during WWII. Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan go hand in hand and it\u2019s not surprising that Isayama would bleed Nazi dogma into his work too in order to make the story more\u00a0\u2018exotic\u2019. However, unlike things such as Evangelion\u2019s (canonically meaningless) Christian imagery, this is absolutely deliberate and meaningful due to Isayama\u2019s political views. It walks like a duck, it quacks like a duck, it matches the field guide\u2019s description of a duck....if I broke this down any more I\u2019d literally be feeding it you like baby food. Also, do people still deny Hetalia has the same thing going on too?\n\n\nIt\u2019s not some grimdark \u201cEd Edd and Eddy takes place in purgatory\u201d-type crackpot raving, people have been outraged about this for years since it came out. I simply pointed out that it kept going and \ngot worse\n. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t even anticipating the post to go viral.

IFS calls this \u201cblending\u201d: a condition in which the Self identifies with a part, as in \u201cI want to kill myself\u201d or \u201cI hate you.\u201d Notice the difference from \u201cA part of me wishes that I were dead\u201d or \u201cA part of me gets triggered when you do that and makes me want to kill you.\u201d \nSchwartz makes two assertions that extend the concept of mindfulness into the realm of active leadership. The first is that this Self does not need to be cultivated or developed. Beneath the surface of the protective parts of trauma survivors there exists an undamaged essence, a Self that is confident, curious, and calm, a Self that has been sheltered from destruction by the various protectors that have emerged in their efforts to ensure survival. Once those protectors trust that it is safe to separate, the Self will spontaneously emerge, and the parts can be enlisted in the healing process. \nThe second assumption is that, rather than being a passive observer, this mindful Self can help reorganize the inner system and communicate with the parts in ways that help those parts trust that there is someone inside who can handle things. Again neuroscience research shows that this is not just a metaphor. Mindfulness increases activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and decreases activation of structures like the amygdala that trigger our emotional responses. This increases our control over the emotional brain. \nEven more than encouraging a relationship between a therapist and a helpless patient, IFS focuses on cultivating an inner relationship between the Self and the various protective parts. In this model of treatment the Self doesn\u2019t only witness or passively observe, as in some meditation traditions; it has an active leadership role. The Self is like an orchestra conductor who helps all the parts to function harmoniously as a symphony rather than a cacophony.\n--Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "ordinaryredtail", "id": 645839225975111680, "date": "2021-03-16 18:44:42 GMT", "timestamp": 1615920282, "tags": ["god yall need to learn to not believe anything coming from an anon", "if they arent brave enough to tell it to you off anon then it probably isnt true", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZUOxEdZsUrgkGe00", "note_count": 48, "body": "Honestly tumblr users would literally jump off a cliff if someone they didn\u2019t know told them to because \u201cthere\u2019s a mattress at the bottom so its safe\u201d"}, {"blog_name": "dark-magician-girl-meets-world", "id": 159733820338, "date": "2017-04-18 23:59:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1492559942, "tags": ["not all men", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZEZzCh2KmuAko", "note_count": 3, "body": "Have you ever noticed what a weirdly low standard\u00a0\u201cNot All Men/Not All White People\u201d is?

These people are crying because Markus, an android created with black skin, removes said skin in order to go on television and make a declaration of freedom, presumably so that he can hide what he really looks like. Something something racism something something ethnic-washing.\nBut like, y\u2019all realize that Markus, who isn\u2019t a human, was \ncreated\n with human features by the people who made him in order for him to fit \ntheir\n image, right? When I played that scene for the first time, it felt like someone who was oppressed and created explicitly to reinforce the comfort of another class of individuals was shedding one prominent aspect of that comfort in order to show who he really was, what he really looked like. He wasn\u2019t speaking to all of humanity with the face of a human, something that would put them at ease, but with his true and real face, the one hidden under the illusion of a black man\u2019s face. He as pulling off a mask because he is, in fact, not human. I\u2019m not saying David Cage wrote him doing it that way on purpose, I would never give him that much credit, but the subtext of that is definitely there, like an indentured servant ridding themselves of an anglicized name and going back to their true, original name. They both can be considered similar acts of rebellion and reclamation.\nAnd before anyone says it, I also 100% get that later on in the camps that the androids are being carted off to the human guards force them to take their skin off, but that\u2019s two sides of one coin. Markus \nchose\n to rid himself of a mask when showing that he is an unapologetic, autonomous, free-thinking android, where Kara and Alice are stripped of that (and their clothes) in a way that is meant to objectify them to their guards, the people killing them, so they can create separation between the people they\u2019re killing and themselves. It\u2019s way easier to look at Kara without her human-looking skin and justify that she\u2019s \u201cjust a machine.\u201d To go back to my previous example, Markus choosing to show his face is like reverting from a name given to you by a master or employer to your original name from your guardians or a name from your culture, where Kara and Alice being forced to take away their skin is like someone taking away a name given to you and categorizing you under a number instead.\nAnyway, there\u2019s your tea for today.

It also  perpetuates a very reactionary, \u201cwestern\u201d (I take issue with this term but it\u2019s the best I have for this) logic where you can quantify and distinctly categorize people and their identities which, when you actually look out into the world and within yourself, is an incredibly silly idea. When you turn the queer community into a bunch of extremely distinct, very specifically defined labels, you\u2019re not only undermining the power of solidarity (seeing what we have in common as well as the differences between us), you\u2019re also engaging in historical revisionism. This idea of extremely separate, politicized identity labels was not at all the case in the queer community as a whole historically, and it\u2019s proponents historically were: transphobic lesbian separatists. It\u2019s not \u201clesbopbobic\u201d or \u201cbiphobic\u201d to point out that making distinct borders within the queer community harms nblw, wlw, and nblnb people who feel alienated by these increasingly specific labels. If you can understand that non-binary people can be lesbians, understanding that m-spec people can have a relationship with the lesbian identity is not that big of a stretch. Drawing needless lines in the sand only helps the right stoke the flames of inter-queer infighting and diminishes our collective power. This isn\u2019t a settled issue, definitely, but I can\u2019t help but feel that people who claim bi/pan lesbianism is transmisogynistic are poisoning the well. Yes, people have used these labels in transphobic ways; but I\u2019ve seen an equal amount of transmisogyny and non-binaryphobia from bi/pan lesbian exclusionists, perhaps more so actually. The more people try to turn the labels I\u2019ve felt comfort in into extremely specific labels which you must fit all the proper criterion for before you even think about identifying with, the more I feel alienated from my queer siblings. I feel like I\u2019m not welcome in any section of the queer community because every increasingly siolized and separatist identity wants to have a sign on the door that says \u201cif you don\u2019t fit into our extremely specific and reactionary requirements, you\u2019re a bigot and you should fuck off and die\u201d. It\u2019s incredibly upsetting to me as someone who\u2019s queer identities are quite fluid and who increasingly feels unwelcome in queer spaces because of this. Human beings are far more complicated than these increasingly separatist and, again, siloized conceptualizations of queer identities allow. Nobody is saying that if you\u2019re a lesbian you have to be m-spec but declaring lesbianism or gayness as an 100% non-m-spec label is ahistorical and reproduces \u201cwestern\u201d quantifiability-of-human-behavior logic.\nIf you\u2019re more interested in reactionary separatism than inter-queer solidarity, go ahead and unfollow me. I have no patience for you.

It's quite...disgusting (I'm unsure of what word to use), and portraying a 10 year-old child in a relationship with a 24 year old man (let alone someone who the child views as a father figure) definitely raises some questions. And, if put into the Dadvid AU (which shouldn't be touched by pedophila) would also count it as incest. On another note, you also seem to be fine with a range of NSFW of it. Overall, I'm confused at your actions.\nBut, you don't whitewash Max (at least), so I guess I'll give you that.\nTo end this message, I have no intention of threatening you, outing you, or being rude.

(i haven't seen one streamer be suggested who is a YT streamer) \nin my opinion, it is much more beneficial for mcc pride to have cishet but popular streamers participate than LGBTQ streamers who pull on average maybe 100 viewers. more viewers ultimately means more donations so more money going to the trevor project. i do agree that there is a lack of diversity and representation in this mcc but overall i believe that donations > representation in this context. \ni saw someone an analogy that worked really well here: you are more likely to buy something from someone you regularly watch (or even someone you have heard of) rather than someone you have never seen before. in this MCC, you are more likely to donate to a streamer you are familiar with/watch rather than a streamer who you only discovered on the day of MCC team releases. it would actually be more damaging (imo) to only have smaller LGBTQ+ streamers in this MCC purely because of the decrease in viewership therefore the decrease in donations towards a good cause!!\nas i said at the beginning of the post, i feel like people are getting very caught up in focusing on LGBTQ+ streamers who are not in this event rather than the streamers in the community who are in this MCC! you cannot go around posting about lack of inclusivity when you will not support them in the future/outside of MCC. if you are (understandably) disappointed in the lack of LGBTQ streamers in this event or your favourite LGBTQ+ cc isn't in this MCC it is a good opportunity to watch one of the CCs in the community who is streaming! this would support both the event, the charity, and the streamer within the community :D \n(don't beg for LGBTQ+ streamers to be included only to watch your fave straight boys stream again and not support that LGBT streamer in any way after they get in - that sounds like performative activism which a lot of people like to scream about)"}, {"blog_name": "futtbuckers", "id": 159012196262, "date": "2017-03-30 20:36:27 GMT", "timestamp": 1490906187, "tags": ["not baby stuff", "discourse", "mickey mouse clubhouse", "house of mouse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZBh7Fe2K5tO_c", "note_count": 10, "body": "NO FUCK YOU MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE IS FOR BABIES HOUSE OF MOUSE IS FOR KIDS "}, {"blog_name": "iamthediscourse-blog", "id": 128041392213, "date": "2015-08-31 17:42:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1441042935, "tags": ["donald trump", "discourse", "it's so silly"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZmBTox1tFt9XL", "note_count": 0, "body": "Hey tumblr can we stop the whole trump is Hitler discourse?

Seriously, Ron's bravery to go into a forest full of his phobia knowingly is not appreciated enough). \nI think the clue to reading Neville's Boggart is looking at Hermione's - which manifested as McGonagall telling her she failed everything. McGonagall is not her fear, \nfailure\n is. \nWhat I believe is happening with Neville is the fear of an authority figure who will never find him \ngood enough\n. \nThis is his deeper fear - seeded in by his grandmother who is constantly comparing him to his father since his childhood. In school, he simply transferred/ projected that insecurity and fear onto a teacher who treated him shabbily.  In his fight with boggart, he overlays both (I won't get into Lupin being petty here, just the source of Neville's fear)\nBoggart also plays on your \nrecent\n fears - as we see with Molly, who has been anxious about her family for quite sometime. And Harry with Dementors. And just before this chapter, we see a Snape class that doesn't go well for Neville. \nSo while I don't get the performative outrage the fandom goes over Neville seeing Snape instead of Bellatrix - I feel that's an inaccurate reading of Neville. But I also feel iffy about posts calling it childish fear because  I feel that's inaccurate too. The deeper thing at play is Neville trying and failing to please authority figures who just won't find him good enough. This arc of his resolved by Deathly Hallows when his grandmother \nfinally\n sends him a letter about how proud she is of him, the approval he was waiting for all his life.

Of course they are. They have to be.\u00a0\nWhen I watched that last Malec scene in 2x18 it felt like a break-up to me.  And yes I\u2019m aware Magnus didn\u2019t say those exact words. Alec\u2019s face looked like he felt like it was a break-up to me. Magnus looked like he was doing something he really didnt want to be doing (because he loves Alec) but he felt he had no choice but to do. Still, I didn\u2019t want to believe it was, but then the show referred to it as such many times in the past few days. I realize this can just be freeform marketing trying to stir up stuff and get us all worked up (good job ff), but I don\u2019t think so.\nHere\u2019s the thing. \nPeople break-up. Not all break ups are permanent\n. People break up and get back together all the time. When you feel there is no other way and you just can\u2019t be with someone for whatever reason, you might split up. You may still love each other. You may decide to work it out and get back together. We all know Malec isn\u2019t going to be apart forever. We hope it isn\u2019t for long, but I seriously wouldn\u2019t put it past the show to drag it out to season 3. It\u2019s a riveting and emotional storyline.\nI\u2019ve heard others say (including some friends) that there is no way possible this is a break-up. I\u2019ts just an argument or that they are just taking a break to figure things out or get through the upcoming battle. They believe they are going to work it out soon and everything is going to be fine.\nObviously this is subjective, and I think most of us are just trying our best to get through this Malec pain. Maybe you believe this is not a breakup because Magnus didn\u2019t say those exact words, and you think the show is just hyping it up and its all going to be good in 19. Maybe you are like me and you are taking the network at their words and\u00a0 believing it is more fractured than that and that they will get back together in S3. I tend to expect the worst as a way of guarding my heart and I understand that others believe the best as a way of guarding theirs.\nBut whether you are the first or the second or somewhere in the middle, it \nDOES NOT\n make you any less of a Malec fan. It doesn\u2019t mean you love them less. It doesnt mean you want them to be broken up.\u00a0\nIn my opinion Magnus and Alec are broken up right now. I know they are endgame. I know they are going to get back together. I do not know how long it will take. I don\u2019t think this is going to be an easy fix. I understand the reasons and I\u2019m not placing blame on either of them. My heart hurts so much over this BECAUSE of how much I adore them. I know that if there is a life and death situation either one of them would risk life and limb to save the other. I know they love each other immensely regardless of their relationship status. I spend hours writing fics about these two because I love them. I devote time to beta-ing and blogging and watching and fangirling and getting emotionally invested because I love them.\n So, trust me when I say that I am not a bad fan because I choose to use the words\u00a0\u201cbreak up\u201d and\u00a0\u201cMalec\u201d in the same sentence.\nOthers don\u2019t love something less than you just because they don\u2019t interpret it the same way you do. We all filter everything through the lens of our past experiences. Our hearts and heads are all different.\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "pockopeas", "id": 654890353275568128, "date": "2021-06-24 16:28:29 GMT", "timestamp": 1624552109, "tags": ["tubbos chat too but i never have it open. his donos dont show up on stream so i dont have to percieve.", "ranboo critical", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZotaTjaMeqvvqW00", "note_count": 15, "body": ">opens a ranboo stream because i love ranboo and his content\n>regrets immediately because his donos and chat are so fucking ://///////"}, {"blog_name": "florenceisfalling", "id": 669916447405981696, "date": "2021-12-07 13:01:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1638882110, "tags": ["why did i have to see this on my dash", "discourse", "my fear domain"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZGAHTebC1NMaqq00", "note_count": 3, "body": "why are there people who are anti-jonelias because its \"problematic\" as if it isnt a horror podcast where the entire point is that dark bad things happen"}, {"blog_name": "coldcocoamilk", "id": 173051028840, "date": "2018-04-18 03:34:06 GMT", "timestamp": 1524022446, "tags": ["discourse", "ace discourse", "nb discourse", "bisexual discourse", "pan discourse", "personal", "ok to interact"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZS4DLl2XAfILe", "note_count": 4, "body": "hey uhhh if we could stop personally attacking participants of discourse esp when its unrelated to the topic that'd be greeeeeat \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "melasprites", "id": 173868565412, "date": "2018-05-13 19:24:26 GMT", "timestamp": 1526239466, "tags": ["not sprite", "mel chats", "Discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zf6Gga2XxNyEa", "note_count": 5, "body": "Hey so my good friend \n@the-god-of-names\n said that if you have any problems with me about my bi Elwurd hc you should talk to them about it, anyway I'm not gonna answer people who come into my inbox or my IMs to start more drama about that subject. \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "dracomoray", "id": 181269013156, "date": "2018-12-20 13:50:21 GMT", "timestamp": 1545313821, "tags": ["discourse", "opinion", "ace discourse", "asexuality", "jes rambles", "i'm ace so if you got smth against me just say so"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zb1NKZ2eqUQAa", "note_count": 24, "body": "Ace discourse is so fucking stupid because it's one of  the many things that isn't an irl problem but people here just??

I caught myself building mental walls and thoughts such as \"Be prepared to say no\" and \"You do not need to listen to their reasons, you are vaild\" started to come to mind. It wasn't super strong or panic induced or anything but, it was enough for my defenses kick in.\nAnd the way Arin talked.....It was tense. A similar tone you would hear if he were playing a tension based horror game. \n\nThe difference between the Danny collabs and JonTron collabs is astounding. \nArin sounds relaxed and happy, he laughs more, when ever he describes Danny it's in an incredibly positive and happy way, like you can feel the bromance through the screen.\n\nThe voice and dialect patterns between them make it very clear they are good friends within moments of listening to them.\n\nArin's not exactly the embodiment of sunshine but I'll be dammed if I didn't say he was a blue sky that deserved all the sunshine it could get. And if anyone wanted to talk to Arin like JonTron did they could fuck right off.\n\nThird: Lots of YouTube channels stopped using slurs and basing all their jokes on minorities. JonTron stuck his heels into the ground and just never stopped or moved on with the times. \n\nFourth: Do I even need to mention the stream?\n\n\nNah man, I don't.\n\n\nOverall: That dude's an asshole and GameGrumps dodged a fucking bullet."}, {"blog_name": "dorkydelphox", "id": 167217693558, "date": "2017-11-07 02:45:16 GMT", "timestamp": 1510022716, "tags": ["personal", "discourse", "i think?", "all sorted out tho", "hopefully things go back to the usual calm soon now that theyre gone"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZuiiUv2RkyuDs", "note_count": 3, "body": "gosh that was exhaustive to experience\nim physically tired from that somehow"}, {"blog_name": "iicraft505", "id": 162498044699, "date": "2017-07-02 04:41:00 GMT", "timestamp": 1498970460, "tags": ["and it's not even 'hate' lol", "just I like one better than the other", "iicraft505", "and I know I'm a hypocrite saying this", "discourse", "vague"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZR2JDm2NLesCR", "note_count": 0, "body": "I mean really if you can\u2019t scroll past fandom hate in a tag then you really shouldn\u2019t be using the internet"}, {"blog_name": "dragonprancing", "id": 164007671037, "date": "2017-08-10 02:48:59 GMT", "timestamp": 1502333339, "tags": ["voltron discourse", "come on bex really", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZEpEKe2OlddJz", "note_count": 1, "body": "God I wish I was Steven right about now\n"}, {"blog_name": "softbitchvibes", "id": 166366558231, "date": "2017-10-13 19:21:29 GMT", "timestamp": 1507922489, "tags": ["harry styles", "this is the truth", "discourse", "bee talks"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZCYiOq2QyE3WN", "note_count": 1, "body": "discourse: harry looked better with his tarzan hair\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "autisticclaraoswald", "id": 161331065984, "date": "2017-06-01 22:45:45 GMT", "timestamp": 1496357145, "tags": ["discourse", "I guess"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZSRO3q2MG5BI0", "note_count": 0, "body": "I really really love taz and I really really love Magnus and Travis but every time Travis makes Magnus act like a dick in the backstory episodes it forces me to remember that he's doing the whole 'civilizing nature of women' thing on top of the fact that he already fridged Julia and it pisses me off so much"}, {"blog_name": "yandere-clown", "id": 647576041011970048, "date": "2021-04-04 22:50:38 GMT", "timestamp": 1617576638, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZLt6juZyflfnae00", "note_count": 17, "body": "christians are an oppressed minority in china. does that mean that they\u2019re oppressed worldwide?

He's outgoing and curious and this is a skater with whom he hasn't competed before this event, so the photo is a conversational gambit to get to know this guy better. Victor can be flaky and selfish, but he's not so self-absorbed that he wouldn't recognize a fellow competitor (unlike Yuuri... to be fair, Yuuri's self-involvement results from anxiety and not ego, but still).\nIt really doesn't make sense given the mechanics of the situation. The Grand Prix series is 6 events leading up to the finale. All skaters involved compete in 2 events, events that are televised and/or livestreamed, and other skaters do watch the events if they can, or at least keep track of who makes the podium. There's interviews and press conferences. And the skaters with the highest score go on to the Finale.\nSix skaters. There are 6 (six) (roku) (\u516d) (\u0428\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c) skaters in the GPF. They stay at the same hotel. The warm up in the same rink at the same time. They share the same staging area before and during the 2-day competition. \nIt is astronomically improbable that Victor did not see Yuuri on the ice, that he did not know he was a fellow skater.\nAnd of course, the commemorative photo scene itself takes place at the venue. Yuuri is still wearing his skater tags, standing next to his coach and a member of the press, and lugging a suitcase (something I doubt a spectator would have with them).\nVictor would not only have to be massively self-involved to not know Yuuri was a skater, he'd also have to be blind. So... why? Why does every other fic in the fandom have Victor not recognizing Yuuri as a skater?

I\u2019ll give it that but I can\u2019t ship them. Here are my outlined reasons why.\n1: I never saw a connection between them as a couple.\nDespite the fact (and it is a fact, shove your arguments aside) that there are a lot of romantic implications for Shinoa to have a crush on Yuu and Yuu also being able to show more care for Shinoa more than the other characters; I don\u2019t see them as a couple. Best friends who enjoy teasing the hell out of each other maybe, but not a couple.\u00a0\nHell when I saw these two tease-fight each other, I thought their little friendship was adorable. I didn\u2019t even think to see these two as a couple until Guren made that stupid little comment to get Shinoa to leave him alone. Even then I didn\u2019t take it seriously\u00a0until the famous\u00a0\u201cYuu held her face and Shinoa is blushing\u201d scene. It wasn\u2019t until that scene that I realized that the series is just gonna continue rolling with this idea of Yuu and Shinoa as a couple. Almost every scene with these two ends up becoming overly romantic in the strangest ways possible.\u00a0\nMe no likey.\u00a0\n2: The shippers.\nI can feel the backlash already.\u00a0\nBut no I\u2019m not gonna say they are extremely toxic or anything like that but, goddamn. From what I\u2019ve seen from the YuuNoa posts that appear when I search up\u00a0\u201cSeraph of the End,\u201d I see some posts that could add and dispel discourse at the same time. Like, are ya\u2019ll okay or something?\u00a0\n3: Fancontent\nThey\u2019re cute. All of them but umm...even the ones that are rated\u00a0\u201cg\u201d, can you not make Shinoa just an object of desire or like all she wants is sex? Or tag it\u00a0\u201cNSFW\u201d? Cause seeing Yuu and Shinoa stick their tongue\u2019s down each others throats is gross.\nWhile we\u2019re at it, can you make your headcannons at least bear some cannon facts? Or maybe have the headcannons actually coincide with the personality given to them? Cause some of them are way too OOC.\u00a0\n4:\u00a0\u201cKnight in Shining Armor\u201d effect\nThis is cute but in the current story; this isn\u2019t what they need.\u00a0\nShinoa, at the current moment, does not need someone to save her from her life as a Hiragi. Yes, her situation in the Hiragi family is terrible as hell and yes Yuu taught her how to care, so and so, etc. But the fact still remains that Shinoa running away from her life as a Hiragi needs to addressed and, personally, I think Yuu saving Shinoa from them won\u2019t help either. It\u2019s just gonna get worse.\nSo Shinoa needs to face her family. What she needs is someone that will encourage her, support her and be blunt with her in getting her to take the Hiragi family name seriously.\u00a0\nWhile Yuu\u2019s love for wanting to keep his family alive and all is great, I can\u2019t see Yuu being so accepting in allowing Shinoa to do this until someone gets it to his head that this is necessary. And that is proven to be difficult since Yuu is mostly running with his emotions.\nWell, that\u2019s it. I can\u2019t ship Yuunoa for these reasons and I don\u2019t think I ever will.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "midoriyasbones", "id": 161253109137, "date": "2017-05-30 21:09:49 GMT", "timestamp": 1496178589, "tags": ["if you want proof i'll get the screens", "discourse", "voltron", "voltron discourse", "klance", "shaladin"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZOuxPg2MBRosH", "note_count": 176, "body": "attention\nstop painting all klance shippers as nasty horrible people. it was ONE person. and yeah, we\u2019ve got a couple nut cases in this community but you know what?

Laurent being feminized by the fandom is certainly a problem;\nhowever it\u2019s also a problem to connect being a man with traditionally performed\nmasculinity. Some things to consider and remember: \n1 \u2013 There are people who have those kinds of relationships. Fitting\ninto gay stereotypes does not diminish the value of the relationship at all. \n2 \u2013 These stereotypes only become heteronormative and\nproblematic when they are imposed on characters who, like Damen and Laurent, \ncanonically do not fit into that narrative.\n\n\n3 \u2013 Outside of those parameters, a more feminine and more\nmasculine man in a relationship are not performing heteronormativity, closer to\nbeing heterosexual, or emulating heterosexuality in any way. This is not\npossible because they \nnot heterosexual\n.\n They are both men and being or\nacting more feminine will not change that.\n4 \u2013 The insinuation that masculinity performed in a\nnon-traditional or non-aggressive way is more feminine, that certain superficial characteristics are tied to masculinity, and that gay\nrelationships that have a clearer large/small, top/bottom, masc/fem dynamic are\nmore heterosexual, closer to heterosexuality, or heteronormative is quite\nhomophobic and transphobic.\nThe issue of Laurent being portrayed more feminine in the\nfandom is a problem \nbecause Laurent is\nnot this way canonically, and therefore it  becomes heteronormative fandom\nbehaviour.\n \nI feel like it\u2019s important\nfrom what I\u2019ve seen to be making this distinction."}, {"blog_name": "exceptionallyace", "id": 148896252393, "date": "2016-08-13 20:06:45 GMT", "timestamp": 1471118805, "tags": ["ace discourse", "discourse", "mental health", "stay safe"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZQgDei2Agw87f", "note_count": 42, "body": "With all the discourse going on, just remember to stay safe.

Both on here and through friends, i\u2019ve found ace people that genuinely have had experiences fairly similar to lgbt folks. being confused about what they are, being forced to, forcing themselves to, and/or being expected to go against how they feel they should, having to choose in conversations whether or not to be honest about who they are, losing friends or significant others over the matter, how it affects the people they can date, so on and so forth.\nsome people would say they dont belong because posts complaining or joking abt allosexual people will include lgbt people, but then does that mean gay people cant complain/joke about straights since there\u2019s straight trans people? or that trans people cant complain about cis people bc of cis LGB people? So this logic doesn\u2019t really follow through.\nreally, the only reason I can find as to why they shouldnt be part of the community is because being ace has nothing to do with gender. gay/lesbian/bi people are connected by dating people of the same gender, and trans people are connected by our gender. these two groups overlap historically and continue to because of how we view gender and thereby sexuality. a cishet ace person will lack this and like, they just wont be able to relate or connect with a lot of the shit we talk about.\u00a0\nso...I really don\u2019t know.

You don't need to like him as the Black Paladin, but please stop the amount of shit you're throwing at him. Did he do a horrible job at first? Yes. Ni doubt at all. But he was in a really emotional state after having to accept that the Only person who cared about him (at least in Keith's eyes) is gone and everyone keeps pushing him to take the role of a leader and make the decisions. No one tried to come with ideas in the first battle with switched Lions and just kept saying \"Keith, what are we supposed to do?!\"\nAnd yes, it was REALLY BAD. I'm not saying it wasn't. But to keep saying that he didn't care at all if his teammates dies is taking it a bit too far. Yes, he shouldn't have left Allura, he Seriously needs to work on his way of handling things. But he DID follow what Allura had told him while being in such an emotional state. \"The mission is more important than the person\". That is basically what Allura said. And while she meant that they can't put off the mission because a person is gone for long, I can kind of see Keith's way of thinking when throwing those Words back at her. \nAgain, YES, it is horrible. But he is not a horrible person. You could clearly see how much he regretted his actions when Lance managed to calm him down. And ever since that moment Keith was on his way to become a better leader. He was more careful about risking the team and when \"Shiro\" came back Keith came up with rather good ideas on how to handle certain situations, but then everyone worked against him because they're used to following Shiro. So when he actually started to become Good the others pushed him away from the leader role.\nAnd we know that Keith can lead when he's comfortable in his position. When flying Red he could easily step into the leading role and give orders whener something happened and Shiro couldn't do anything. So all in all, Keith was a bad leader because he didn't feel comfortable in his New role. He had just lost Shiro and with him a part of himself. \nAnd again, Keith doesn't have to fly Black again and you don't need to like him flying Black, but can you just tone it down a little about how terrible or \"useless\" he was?

So that\u2019s cool. \nLike, I get that sometimes the most important posts don\u2019t get a lot of immediate reaction because people have to think about them and then it\u2019s gone and you don\u2019t have a way to react to it any more. So I try to not put too much weight on likes and reblogs? But it does anyways mean that some people found the concept meaningful and worth sharing so that\u2019s good to know. \nPersonally, my coming out has been really, really slow, in part because I don\u2019t really need most people to treat me differently and I don\u2019t plan on (medically) transitioning. On \nthis\n site, initially I didn\u2019t want to put up pronouns but also wanted to signal that I was trans friendly so I felt very weird about that (some people put up \u201cI don\u2019t care about my pronouns but I do care about yours\u201d or something like that, which is one way of dealing with things; I think I might have had my birth pronouns up for a bit) and then later on I got more clarity that I \ndo\n like some pronouns more than others and then after a certain amount of wading through \u201cbut maybe pronoun requests are for \nreal\n trans people, not for me\u201d and then at some point I rewrote my blog description and got them out there.\nAnd when I\u2019m in a social (zoom) space where some people are putting their pronouns up next to their name, I get a certain amount of \u201cam I ready for this specific group of people to know yet?\u201d and sometimes I go with my birth pronouns again. (Which, by the way, I\u2019m fine with. I get some euphoria from he/him but I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s because I like them \nbetter\n or because it\u2019s the novelty or because masculine pronouns plus feminine name and body shape equals about the level of genderfuck I\u2019m aiming for. But she/her doesn\u2019t feel \nbad\n. If she/her felt \nbad\n I would probably feel a lot more urgency in this whole coming out thing.)\n(And who knows how I\u2019ll feel down the line. It\u2019s a journey.)\nAnyways. Apparently having strong feels about pronouns is very common for trans people, but \nnot\n having strong feels is pretty common as well. And strong feels about pronouns can be in conflict with strong feels about not wanting to deal with potential transphobia/general weirdness. So there are many reasons why transgender people might be evasive about pronouns, and you \nreally\n can\u2019t just assume that someone being reluctant to share pronouns means that they\u2019re cisgender. \nLikewise, if a person you\u2019re \nassuming\n is cis wants to put down pronouns that don\u2019t match their gender presentation, you take that seriously. Even if you\u2019re \npretty sure\n they\u2019re just messing around. Even if they \nare\n, it still signals to anyone else present that you don\u2019t have to \nlook\n like anything in particular to expect to be called a given set of pronouns. \n(And they might be doing a sort of trial thing where they can fall back on \u201cyeah, just messing around\u201d if they get too nervous. Ya never know. If they\u2019ve actively expressed transphobic ideas or been that sort of ... confrontationally confused that people sometimes are, you still don\u2019t know. Transphobia is not actually a property of being cisgender.) (You can still expect better behavior of course.)\nA room where about half the people have pronouns on their name tags and half don\u2019t, or a zoom session where about half the people have pronouns next to their names and half don\u2019t, is actually a pretty good situation for new/exploring/potentially trans people to be in. It doesn\u2019t need to be \neverybody\n, and failure to be forthcoming about pronouns doesn\u2019t automatically indicate being transphobic."}, {"blog_name": "gayrados", "id": 163993149144, "date": "2017-08-09 19:02:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1502305363, "tags": ["I'm just here......to have fun.......", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zz5nLs2OkmDxO", "note_count": 3, "body": "I am how you say upset that I\u2019m still seeing discourse abt the ages"}, {"blog_name": "rekanochi", "id": 160367482528, "date": "2017-05-06 12:57:00 GMT", "timestamp": 1494075420, "tags": ["reka rambles", "discourse", "i guess"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7iSzk2LMfPQW", "note_count": 1, "body": "people who make cringe compilations and shit are, usually, assholes who hate fun and enjoy poking fun at kids\nor just generally assholes \nsometimes there's exceptions ofc but im very tired of seeing people make CRINGE COMPILATIONS LUL!!!!!!! and it's just kids being kids on a game for kids"}, {"blog_name": "cantriip", "id": 155474184906, "date": "2017-01-06 08:06:19 GMT", "timestamp": 1483689979, "tags": ["your emporer speaks", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z1Ec1f2Go_yhA", "note_count": 1, "body": "okay. so. that post got one actually education reply, the rest are calling me, a trans person, a transphobe. and like i\u2019m sure i understood the other way but it seemed to be erasing the fact that ***in the beginning*** transpeople were /not/ welcome in the movement. so i guess that a summary of why i should not engage or bother to learn anything. yes? yes."}, {"blog_name": "eclectic-sunflower", "id": 661224936466186240, "date": "2021-09-02 14:33:59 GMT", "timestamp": 1630593239, "tags": ["discourse", "long post"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZkKEBTaj99EEie00", "note_count": 0, "body": "here\u2019s a fun idea: don\u2019t fucking exclude people from discourse because they aren\u2019t directly impacted by it\nif they can\u2019t participate in the conversation, then they won\u2019t be able to learn about what not to do or, more importantly, what \nto \ndo. by excluding somebody from discourse, you are running the risk of creating an echo chamber which never leads to anything good.\nthis doesn\u2019t mean tolerate intolerance, by all means tell people to fuck off if they\u2019re being an ass! but don\u2019t exclude somebody on principle from participating just because they aren\u2019t trans or gay or lesbian. cishets and white people have privilege and don\u2019t have the same experiences, but cishets and white people can\u2019t learn about those experiences if they\u2019re not even part of the conversation. \nsomebody is genuinely trying to learn, don\u2019t great them with \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to participate in the discourse\u201d because that feels like you\u2019re relegating them to the kids\u2019 table. still let them know, hey, be respectful and listen to those the discourse effects, but if you\u2019re not (reasonably) welcoming, why should they be?\nshort version is, do unto others a mix of what they do unto you and what you would have them do unto you.

the story sucked me in). i loved it. \ni\u2019m not an avid shipper of johnlock, but i always like the idea of more representation in shows and i think it would be cool to have the two of them be together for the sake of having two big name, classic characters be gay in a show that is hugely popular.\nthe show has its issues. there isn\u2019t a lot of racial representation. the women have their moments of being great and strong but are oftentimes written badly. there aren\u2019t enough of them.\ndespite this, i was pretty hopeful for this season. i loved the first three. i loved the addition of mary, i loved her AGRA storyline, i even liked the idea of eurus. \nbut that last episode, man, it was just so\u2026weird, anticlimactic. throughout all this time i\u2019ve been watching (since 2012), i was always SO trusting in mofftiss and always assumed they knew what they were doing, but the storylines have just been kind of fisted for me. \nkilling mary was a mistake; if they killed her they should have at least made her evil so it didn\u2019t seem like her death was just a means to further sherlock and john being together (not that i\u2019m against them being together. in fact, i\u2019m in favor of it). it just seems unrealistic that a mother would leave her baby so these men could be together in a platonic way. it just seems kind of disrespectful, i don\u2019t know. \nthe writers really treat molly badly, and i think that sucks.\nthis all being said, the writers don\u2019t technically owe us anything. this is just their interpretation, their fanfiction, if you will. does that mean i can\u2019t be sad about the direction it\u2019s gone in and the lack of LGBT+ representation? no. it just means that i guess we can\u2019t get our hopes up for these types of things because i guess they know what they want to do (maybe?? i can\u2019t tell if they know what they want). \ndisregarding the whole shitstorm of bad, there were some pretty nice things about this last episode. the acting was brilliant, the plot had a lot of scary moments, jim moriarty came back (briefly, in flashbacks\u2026i mean, he was kind of seen as a pawn to eurus, which sucks, but that\u2019s beside the point), and we finally got to learn about redbeard. also, john and sherlock were all domestic and raising rosie. sherlock\u2019s character development has been through the roof. \nam i going to keep watching if there are more episodes? yes. i can\u2019t leave this hellhole now. i don\u2019t know if this is the last season or what. but if it comes on again in a few years, i\u2019ll probably be there, just wishing for some changes, because i don\u2019t like disliking things about a show that is usually pretty well written, a show i\u2019ve liked since i was 13.\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "apotelesmaa", "id": 147907577066, "date": "2016-07-24 19:53:57 GMT", "timestamp": 1469390037, "tags": ["I want to die", "suicide m /", "undertale", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPIykk29l_eJg", "note_count": 3, "body": "Ok I\u2019m sorry for continuing to talk about this but in what kind of sick world is saying \u201cshipping incest is bad\u201d the type of controversial statement that warrants you sick fuckers to send death threats \n\n\nThe undertale fandom is so fucking nasty, not only is shipping incest deemed ok but y'all will fucking harass someone into suicide for making a blog saying that it\u2019s actually not fucking ok you god damn sick freaks."}, {"blog_name": "cliffjumpers", "id": 162165612029, "date": "2017-06-23 15:52:56 GMT", "timestamp": 1498233176, "tags": ["discourse", "text", "i suppose"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZjECgd2N1qjtz", "note_count": 0, "body": "like im stupid pro-mage, if you come at me with that templar rhetoric im gonna tell you to get the fuck out of town, but i still like Vivienne and Cullen as characters even if i dont share their beliefs??

She is smarter than every girl in class, even saying she read all of the books on the reading list in her class and an ace in bio. Nothing ever touches her. Even when she is attacked or hurt, she\u2019s automatically saved and healed perfectly well and is not traumatised or effected by those events. She never develops or changes throughout the story. She is never called out once for her mistakes. She is always in the centre of the universe. Another example is Rey, who a boarderline one, but not quite there. (While I don\u2019t mind Rey as a character, she does have some of the traits of one since she\u2019s only slightly challenged by the narrative and picks up traits fast)\u00a0 For more:\u00a0\n\n Anastasia Steele and a lot of extremely bad YA leads.\u00a0\nA male example would be Kirito from SAO.\u00a0\n\nThe narrative bends in order to make him the centre of the universe constantly, even though it makes no sense (like the fact that with the show\u2019s logic 1 of 9 people are beta testers, so he\u2019s not a special snowflake in the slightest and yet the show treats him like he is). He is able to solve anything with ease without paying for his mistakes or learning from them, especially in the later arcs. Every girl he meets fall instantly in love with him for no reason, including his adopted sister (who is also his cousin, but I don\u2019t consider that incest. Neither here nor there right now).\u00a0In fact, a lot of bad Ieseki (or\u00a0\u201ccharacter from the irl world, who is transported to a video game world\u201d) anime protagonists are Mary Sues for the same exact reasons I listed with Kirito. Some other examples include:\u00a0\n\nEragon, Edward Cullen, Legolas in the LOTR movies, James Bond, Jack Ryan, Tin Tin and any Batman comic written by Frank Miller...or any Batman story in the hands of a bad writer. Luke Skywalker is a borderline Mary Sue himself. (Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have nothing against any of these characters, but I do feel they fall under the Mary Sue Umbrella)\u00a0\nAllura is nothing like any of these examples! She is powerful, sure. But she has weaknesses that are show and exploited throughout the narrative from her falling for the alternate Altean\u2019s words to her AI father tricking her to fly the ship into a sun and almost succeeding.\u00a0 She also is forced to develop throughout the story and isn\u2019t handed things on a sliver plate, she works hard for them and struggles a lot.\u00a0\nSo no, Allura is not a Mary Sue--but an awesome alien princess and a well written character.

The rest of the team takes down the monster but they lose one of the npcs in the process. It\u2019s still worth it in the end when the remaining npcs join your group for the rest of the night. They offer items of support and stories about the past. Maybe they direct you and your group to their npc friends that own a shop you now get a discount at. \nBottom line, I feel like games should make the player emotionally care about the place they\u2019re in and see real rewards and consequences that feel more spontaneous than grinding for experience points."}, {"blog_name": "freespeechfandom-blog", "id": 157369809323, "date": "2017-02-17 21:48:03 GMT", "timestamp": 1487368083, "tags": ["cvgr", "cassie palmer", "discourse", "double standards"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z5BFpe2IZ_Bch", "note_count": 0, "body": "@windsurfingthroughhell:\n- \u201cSo in TtD, Cassie mentioned 3-4 times how much she valued Mircea\u2019s honesty, which made me grind my teeth every damn time because obviously I knew when he was lying or you know, just carefully omitting things.

There are blogs whose opinions i believe in who callout/harass/bully blogs whose opinions I do not believe in at uncomfortably extreme levels. All of this happens everywhere, however this site is a place where these habits form, fester, and metastasize at alarming rates and it\u2019s deeply unsettling.\n\n\u2028I don\u2019t want to be swayed by people who I otherwise respect and care for that one post or one opinion, be it misunderstood, worded wrongly, or otherwise, determines an entire person\u2019s character, that one bad belief gets people thrown into the deep end of irredeemable labels. That an ignorant opinion, no matter how doubtfully or obliviously expressed, deems a person rotten to their core. I feel that these unforgiving terms (homophobic, misogynistic, etc.) being thrown around, being tacked onto young and ignorant users for something as small as misusing a word, is reckless and not okay. All of this has not only created a hateful, unsafe, and toxic environment for everyone, but has also made people doing these actions unreliable as they are grasping at straws, reaching, and taking situations to extreme levels. To group ignorance in the same pool as hate is to either heighten the crime of ignorance or to excuse and lessen the crime of hate. I just don't feel they're the same level of Bad and shouldn't be treated as if they are. \n\n\nNone of this is news to me, in fact several posts address this issue, in shorter and better words than I could ever come up with. These are posts which we all tend to reblog and agree with and then never talk about it again, sometimes going back to the bad habits (even while disagreeing with them)\n\n\u2028I want to keep an open mind, on this site and anywhere else I end up, to educate myself and be aware of everything going on around me, to learn to be more sensitive and considerate to everyone\u2019s needs. Tumblr is very discouraging of this as it believes I and everyone else should already know everything there is to know about this, and to think/believe/speak out of place is cause for immediate punishment and outcast without correction or second chances.

It\u2019s just me lamenting that both sides are constantly talking past each other and never really addressing each other at all.\nTo me, repeating your own side\u2019s talking points without bothering to address/challenge the other side\u2019s just seems like you\u2019re not actually interested in winning the other side over and instead just want to reassure \nyourself \nthat your own position is correct. If your side really is correct and the other side is wrong, then surely it makes sense to engage with them on their terms, as you have nothing to lose if you\u2019re right and they\u2019re wrong? And if it turns out you\u2019re wrong and they\u2019re right, wouldn\u2019t you like to know so you can be in the right too?\nI\u2019m not picking on either side here - both sides do this, constantly talking past each other and not bothering to address the other side\u2019s argument, like they\u2019re speaking different languages. And I\u2019m not just picking on the abortion debate here either - there are so many other contentious issues where each side has just become a closed echo-chamber of their own arguments without ever bothering to actually address the other side\u2019s arguments beyond the occasional strawman.\u00a0\nArguing about ethics\nIt\u2019s even worse when the issue is an ethically charged one like abortion, because both sides don\u2019t want to be morally in the wrong -\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a murderer and won\u2019t negotiate with murderers!\u201d\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a misogynist and won\u2019t negotiate with misogynists!\u201d - and so they don\u2019t \nwant \nto challenge their own views, believing that it\u2019s only giving in to the other evil side and giving them respect they don\u2019t deserve.\u00a0\nBut I believe very few people are actually evil and most people believe they are doing the right thing. I find the idea that pro-choicers actively want to murder babies or that pro-lifers actively want to control women\u2019s bodies ridiculous. Both sides are mostly good people who want to do the right thing. Engaging with the other side isn\u2019t being an \u201capologist\u201d for an evil or oppressive worldview, and nor is it giving evil people the respect they don\u2019t deserve. It\u2019s simply sorting out whether you\u2019re in the right or not.\nTake Christian evangelists or obnoxious vegans, for example. Most of Tumblr, I think, don\u2019t like to be preached to by either group and feel like they\u2019re constantly\u00a0\u201cshoving their beliefs down their throat.\u201d But while I\u2019m not a Christian or a vegan, \nI do understand why they do what they do!\n The Christian evangelist thinks they\u2019re doing the right thing by saving you from hell, and in their mind, they\u2019re fighting the forces of evil - a little annoyance is justified if it keeps you from burning for all eternity. And the vegan thinks they\u2019re doing the right thing by saving animals, and a little patronisation and annoyance is justified if it saves animals. I can understand why they do what they do. People see them as obnoxious arseholes, but they believe that by \nnot \nbeing an obnoxious arsehole, they\u2019re allowing evil or oppression (damning the unsaved to hell, or allowing animals to be exploited) to go unchecked and can\u2019t morally justify \nnot \ndoing what they do. (In case it needed to be said, by the way, I\u2019m referring only to Christian evangelists who constantly feel the need to save you or obnoxious vegans who constantly feel the need to point out you\u2019re in the wrong about not being a vegan - NOT to all Christians or vegans.)\nI feel they\u2019re taking the wrong tack - very few people are actually converted to Christianity by constant moaning about hell and Jesus from street preachers, and very few people are converted to veganism by patronisation and being called animal murderers. Most people who aren\u2019t evangelical Christians or obnoxious vegans understand this, resent the Christians and vegans, and are even turned off Christianity or veganism. \nYet people often don\u2019t get the same thing about their own beliefs! \nPro-choice? All pro-lifers are evil servants of the patriarchy who want to control women\u2019s bodies! Pro-capitalism? All socialists are freedom-haters who want to send us to the gulags! Pro [insert world view here]? All [insert opposing group here] are [insert nefarious evil accusation here]! Shout at them! Mock them! Dox them! Insult them! Physically attack them! They\u2019re not worthy of respect, they\u2019re pure evil and cannot be negotiated with!\nI fully understand the need to fight evil and oppression. I feel that that\u2019s an important part of being a decent human being and something we\u2019re all obliged to do. But I also feel that having to choose between\u00a0\u201cshouting, yelling, dehumanising your opponents, ignoring their points of view and seeing them as evil incarnate who deserve no respect\u201d and\u00a0\u201callowing evil and oppression to go unchecked\u201d is a \nfalse dichotomy! \nI think it\u2019s important to acknowledge the following:\nMost people are not evil. \nMost people want to do the right thing. Because of different information, different experiences, different priorities, etc. their view of what is right may not be the same as yours. But they don\u2019t actively want to do evil deeds. They want to do good, \njust like you.\nThe solution to the \u201cdifferent ideas of good and evil\u201d problem isn\u2019t to treat your opponent as the problem or a monster. The solution is to \ntry and get your opponent to see things from your point of view. The problem is not your opponent, it\u2019s your opponent\u2019s ideas.\u00a0\nShaming, doxxing, insulting, physical violence or threats of violence, ignoring their points of view and dehumanisation are not effective tactics. Instead, they\u2019re more likely to turn both your opponents and people on the fence off your viewpoint, and are almost always morally questionable themselves.\u00a0\nRefusing to engage with your opponents does not help your cause, and it doesn\u2019t make the world a better place. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to catch\u00a0\u201cimpure wrong idea germs\u201d from exposure to people with opposing views! If you\u2019re in the right, \nyou should be able to back your point of view up. \nIf you\u2019re opponent\u2019s in the wrong, \nyou should be able to address their points directly and take them down without attacking them as a person. \nAnd if you\u2019re in the wrong, \nyou should learn and change your position!\nIf all you want to do is uneffectively attack people with wrong ideas or ignore their arguments and shout yours louder rather than try and challenge those ideas directly, you\u2019re not making the world a better place or trying to combat evil. \nYou\u2019re simply being self-righteous and making yourself feel good about yourself without actually helping anyone.\nThere are seven billion people in the world, and naming just one person per second, it would take \n220 years \nto name them all, let alone deal with all their problems and all the injustices in the world. While it\u2019s important to deal with evil and injustice sometimes, \nno person can solve everything all the time. \nWhile it\u2019s important to make people aware of issues, it\u2019s never okay to shame them for not knowing something. And it\u2019s also unrealistic to think that you and everyone else should be trying to change everything in the world all at once. \nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to sit back and do nothing about evil and injustice.\n\u00a0It just means it\u2019s okay to chill once in a while, take care of your own needs as well, and realise that your friend is not necessarily a bad person for not being deeply involved in your own pet cause.\nTrying to fight evil without engaging in evil yourself, trying to make the world a better place for everyone without harming others, and respecting other people as good people even if you think their opinions are harmful aren\u2019t contradictions or a difficult, fine line to cross. Instead, they go together hand in hand. It\u2019s being ineffectively obnoxious and dehumanising the other side that\u2019s \nreally \nincompatible\u00a0with fighting for a better world!\n(I\u2019m looking at you, pro-lifers and pro-choicers. And pro-Israelis and pro-Palestinians. And feminists and egalitarians. And liberals and conservatives. And socialists and capitalists. And vegans, vegetarians and meat-eaters. And atheists and religious people. And just about every morally-charged argument on and off the Internet. And people who like pineapple on pizza and people who don\u2019t. I think there are probably good and evil people on both sides of all these debates and more, who would have a much easier time convincing the other side if they didn\u2019t dehumanise them and sit in a closed ideology echo chamber, convinced that they\u2019d be apologists for evil if they let one dissenting thought in.)"}, {"blog_name": "salcreus", "id": 656343209767731200, "date": "2021-07-10 17:21:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1625937661, "tags": ["oh shit", "Im really reading posts and going  at them", "like its the type of thing you want to laugh at while also feeling awful about it gfmkd", "nah id be out of this fandom if that happened rn i dont think id handle it \ud83d\ude2d", "discourse", "salty rambles", "shoutout to the warriors of both sides fly high", "ive learned sm today about so much useless stuff god bless"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZSkSnTaRpAlyyW00", "note_count": 2, "body": "So I knew that the discourse schtuff from 2019 was a thing, but I just today realized How Much That Sure Was A Thing"}, {"blog_name": "crispygoosehole", "id": 135853542418, "date": "2015-12-24 16:57:36 GMT", "timestamp": 1450976256, "tags": ["fandom", "discourse", "sherlock", "haikyuu!!", "hamilton", "opm", "hannibal", "naruto", "the hunger games", "welcome to night vale", "fallout 4", "star trek", "star wars"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZaHK8k1_XW8mI", "note_count": 2, "body": "Call for help!

That can be useful, but not if you're making it an actual part of a model. It's good for pragmatic purposes until it conflicts with other parts of the model, because it only works in hand-picked contexts. Ideas need to be full-fledged and account for all complexities, and /then/ simplified accordingly within contexts for the sake of swift communication.\n\nI also have questions abt expectations of ally behavior and how it relates to concensus within a marginalized group. Who do allies listen to when deciding how they should act/what they should do? In many cases there is no concensus on issues. In many cases the right answer is considered extreme even within the marginalized group and thus listening to the majority would give an ally the wrong answer. That can be overcome most times by erring on the side of caution, but then there are occasions where two requests conflict in such a way that an ally can only pick one.\n\nAnd that brings me to another problem I have, which is the treatment of allies who are genuinely trying to do a good job and have to make a choice and get yelled at either way. Or allies who are problematic like everyone else, but trying to make progress, and are yelled at/bullied for not being at the same place others are on an issue yet.\n\nThen there's the idea that allies should listen rather than talk being used to silence those who are in fact members of a marginalized group by gatekeeping and calling them allies, which is ime especially an issue for those who dissent on whatever subject. And finally there's the simple problem of a marginalized group dictating on an issue. This is good to a degree, but no one can or should get permission on every issue from groups that can't reach concensus on anything to begin with to use their critical thinking or have an opinion.\n\n People often frame this as someone who is not a chemist debating a chemist about chemistry. Imo it's not a good analogy because unlike chemistry, the experience of marginalization/oppression of one kind provides understanding that can be applied to forms of oppression one does not specifically face. There is a lot of overlap, and the methods by which oppression is executed and the oppressive thought process is very similar across various kinds of oppression. It's more like if chemists in different specialities debated on one of their speciality's, I guess. It would be obtuse to argue with them over those things specific to their specialty, but they will also be using universal chemistry ideas as they are applied to their speciality. Those universal ideas can be debated by the other chemist, which could affect things specific to the first chemist's specialty. Right? And if the first chemist yells at the other for presuming to speak on things that pertain to their specialty, that's not cool.\n\nLike, if we have models of oppression, and many of them apply to more than one kind of oppression, we all get our own opinions on those models. Whether we are specifically talking about your oppression or my oppression, when it gets into models that apply to both, either of us can disagree and be valid. What we can't do is have an opinion for a model when applying it to us/me and a different opinion for the same model when applying it to them/you.\n\nFurther, people should question their teachers. You can view someone as your teacher/an authority on a subject without thinking the same way or reaching the same conclusions. Frequently the differing conclusion will be wrong, but you can't sacrifice your critical thinking just because your teacher is an authority and you are a student. It should be pushed that a marginalized group is the authority on/teacher when it comes to their own marginalization and absolutely must be listened to and their voices given priority, but taking it further than that and saying that those outside that group aren't allowed to have dissenting opinions is too much. You can do the rl equivalent of giving them an F - telling them they're opinion is oppressive, that they're jerks, that you're not friends anymore. That's great, I agree with doing that (most of the time - for cases where someone is listening and making progress and are just behind on an issue, I disapprove of viciousness). But thinking those outside a marginalized group may not dissent is different, and it specifically causes problems, again, when the group doesn't have concensus, which is most of the time.

Don't get me wrong, I love Lost and I actually didn't mind the ending as much as everyone else seems to.\n\nBut Lost and OUAT had the strength of amazing, interesting characters. And then focused on the magic and weird world instead.\n\nLet's take this by seasons. Both first seasons examine the lives of heroes, showing their backstories and providing context for how they became who they are. OUAT has a unique spin: the characters themselves don't know their own past. They don't know why they behave the way they do and are struggling to find their own person in this world that's been concocted for them.\n\nSo in season two, now that their past is recognized, you would think the characters would confront identity head on. And in a way, they do: Prince Charming goes \"I'm both David and the Prince\" and that's a cool message. OUAT could have grown from there, showing the community of Storybrooke binding together in their shared experiences.\n\nEven the outside threats they face could bring about wonderful plots. What happens when the outside world comes to Storybrooke? Has Regina hurt outside parties and do those parties (Greg) deserve justice? How will the characters that lose their memories again like that one dwarf be treated in a town of self-aware fairy tale creatures? How will the characters, like Emma and her parents, treat each other with their new knowledge?\n\nBut then it all kind of devolves into \"what Disney/classical literature characters are attacking this season\" with little regard to the strong characters we started out with. Lost had this problem too: a whole new plane of people coming to the island? Eh, kill em off, nothing interesting going from there. \n\nI'll watch Peter Pan get beat up ever day but without interesting, developed characters trying to work in the normal, day-to-day world around them, why should I care when they win? There's no stake in it.

I like it, it defiently has that fantasy meets Doom feels that people have talking about. The Slayers tiny motiffs/instant personality quirks were cool and identifyable.\nThe priestess being our green/proxy character worked well. I find it interesting that they adress each other by like job classes or titles instead of names.\nThe shows hella graphic tho. Atleast in its opening encounter. It defiently sets the tone immediately of why people would hate goblins.\nBut like this crazy overblown reaction to the first episode. Its trash, torture porn etc. etc.\nLike its graphic, its brutal. But if anyone has ever watched Game of Thrones. You have no reason to complain about this show for a bunch of implications or in one case a pretty disturbing 5 second shot. \nThis is called action oriented mood themeing. Basically it implies the tone of the story content through the actions of the plot instead of exposition. And quite frankly it was done pretty well.\nI will say this tho. The one legit criticism I saw was someone saying theyre should be a content warning for certain shows like on Crunchyroll. And I 100% agree with that. To use my previous example GoT does that why not for certain anime so we can identify what were going into cause teasers and posters can be misleading. \nOther then that. Its a graphic dark fantay show thats gonna explore some pretty dark themes. People wanna cast this stuff off as edgy because it makes them uncomfortable or they dont understand why. But hell replace goblin with human raiders/bandits. Its the same fucking thing. Like these are horrible notions that go on in rl. There's nothing wrong with telling a story or set piece that willingly explores these things and the emotions it makes people feel, instead of pretending they dont exist.\nThat being said. I am curious if its overall plot will hook me. Cause if its characters or plot dont continue with the intial impression of the opening. It'll eventually just fade into obscurity on my watch list. So far the slayer is neat tho.\nSo its promising. We'll see where it goes."}, {"blog_name": "nillytribbles", "id": 154134430758, "date": "2016-12-06 21:49:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1481060998, "tags": ["social construct", "social justice", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZJyuZf2FZ8CGc", "note_count": 0, "body": "I hate when people say \u201cx is a social construct\u201d and then refuse to continue the sentence.

This took a little while to resolve, because it took a while to work out that they were interpreting the naming of the events as a shaming act that implied they should be written off. And this led to me crystallizing some thoughts I have on why it\u2019s actually important to not have this be the default interpretation.\nI do make a particular point of talking about these things when they\u2019re relevant even if it feels a little awkward to say bad things about a person who was an acquaintance. This is because I think bad things have a property analogous to being anti-inductive, but only so long as they are common knowledge. When something is common knowledge, people update- they may take cautionary measures or look for signs to believe it won\u2019t happen again. A person gets less leeway afforded to them to repeat actions, and people who show similar signs they might do the action are more likely to be intervened with in advance. People might ask themselves \u201cdo I think I\u2019m vulnerable to psychotic breaks\u201d, before engaging in weird attempts to do things to their own brain. And a special property of it being common knowledge- people know others will be more willing to listen if they relate ways in which they were similarly treated badly. People know they can push back on things sooner to nip things in the bud.\nThe group updates on the evidence, and if it reoccurs will update further, and bad things stabilise at a low level. Is someone going to have a psychotic break and attack someone again? Probably not, and talking about it helps make sure.\n\n\nThis mechanism breaks utterly if you start trying to protect people\u2019s reputations by not talking about bad things.\nIf your standard for when you talk about things is\u00a0\u201cwhen they\u2019re bad enough you think people are worth writing off\u201d, then you have shutdown all feedback that controls the rate at which bad things happen until those bad things reach the point you\u2019re writing people off for them. In a community that\u2019s pro justice reform, pro rehabilitation, pro redemption? I think people start quietly breaking the norm through whisper networks to protect their inner circle, but never get comfortable enough to say things in public, and even then are doing so late enough it doesn\u2019t work well.\nTalking about things in public isn\u2019t a punishment- it\u2019s information propagation. While punishing people might not be called for, neither is being so worried about the harm done to them via reputational damage to cripple information propagation.\nI\u2019m not saying adopt callouts (although I think \u201chey, this happened\u201d type public notification posts rather than \u201cthis person is terrible\u201d posts are probably a good idea when things happen). I am saying that a\u00a0\u201cculture of silence\u201d is a bad thing, and pushback on something being relevantly brought up is very bad, I think. We shouldn\u2019t have newsworthy negative events involving members of the community which We Don\u2019t Talk About.\nMediation, negotiation, conflict-resolving solutions for dealing with problems are great, when they\u2019re working healthily. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re nearly effective enough to substitute for the massive number of small adjustments that come from permitting the group to update. Also, I\u2019m not a full-blown Hansonite, but I think \nincentives matter\n, even for people who are not morally beyond the pale. Even for people who are genuinely trying to do well as mediators, I expect them to do better when trust must be \nearned\n then maintained by those judgements working and people get to see how they work. Even for people who genuinely want to avoid being bad, I expect them to do so better when they know they\u2019ll be expected to \nhave the backbone to own their actions\n if they do something that the consensus is was wrong. Even for people who genuinely want to improve, I think peer monitoring will make them better at improving. Court cases being public is important; people fancying themselves mediators can\u2019t substitute for transparency and widespread ability to react to evidence.\nAnd where in society we have seen people go\u00a0\u201cthe people outside this room would overreact, it\u2019d damage the Good Cause, so we\u2019re going to deal with this privately, keep you away from the proximate people you did wrong with, and work with you on reform\u201d, well. That seems to be how things go really, really far south, far further south than they could ever have gone if people were able to see the current state at any given time.\u00a0 So this being an apparent implicit norm amongst (some?) Bay Area sorts concerns me enough to argue against it- and explicate the matter so that the people I know can update on the topic, even if they can\u2019t adopt the \u201cavoid that entire hub\u201d option I\u2019m now favouring."}, {"blog_name": "darthsuki", "id": 175589467765, "date": "2018-07-05 23:50:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1530834646, "tags": ["sukirambles", "bnha", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPDsqw2ZXygPr", "note_count": 7, "body": "So I just finished marathoning season 3 of BnHA with my girlfriend and I, to be expected, decided to see what up n\u2019 happening things are going on in the tag/search.

Peter literally says in his video,\u00a0\u201cNo one\u2019s told me why I\u2019m in Berlin... something about Captain America going crazy?\u201d At this point, Peter doesn\u2019t know about the Accords or the Winter Soldiers or any of it. He just knows that the famous Tony Stark has asked him for help.\nwhich, by the way, was deliberate and manipulative of tony but i\u2019ll get to that later.\nOf course, Peter throws himself at the opportunity. After all, Cap says things that Stark said he would say, so obviously Stark is right about everything else! Peter was an excited, overpowered, teenager that Stark \nneeded \non his side.\nPoint Two: Cap\u2019s whole reasoning for not signing the Accords is directly in line with Peter\u2019s moral code. Peter is the hero who saves everyone. No one dies if he can help it. The reason Cap didn\u2019t sign the Accords is because he felt a mediator would inhibit his ability to save as many people as possible.\nAs stated before, Peter didn\u2019t know about the Accords at this point. Had he known that they are what started this whole thing, he definitely would have agreed with Cap.\u00a0\u201cJust looking out for the little guy\u201d and all that. \nPeter would not have signed the Accords of his own free will.\nPoint Three: At the point of the Airport Battle, it was no longer about the Accords. Cap was assembling a team to go fight the Winter Soldiers; Tony was assembling a team of the most powerful to take down Cap. By then, the whole thing was bigger than just Tony vs. Cap. And Peter would have understood that, and realized that priorities had shifted.\nPoint Four: Tony purposefully left Peter in the dark, knowing the kid was eager enough to prove himself that he didn\u2019t care. Though Tony did feel a connection with Peter, he originally brought him into the fight simply because he needed all the hard hitters he could get.\nIn short, Peter Parker was unaware of the true magnitude of the situation, and was simply trying to impress Mr. Stark. If given all of the details and the ability to choose for himself, he definitely would have sided with Cap during Captain America: Civil War.\ni would love to debate this with you guys, but please keep it intellectual. i\u2019m too passionate about this to deal with\u00a0\u201cur dumb\u201d arguments. let me know what you think!\npeople who expressed interest in hearing this: \n@nycspidey\n \n@you-mightas-well-live"}, {"blog_name": "blazevillains", "id": 676390253728301056, "date": "2022-02-17 00:00:12 GMT", "timestamp": 1645056012, "tags": ["there are at least a couple big bloggers i know lmao", "tw proship mention", "discourse", "JUST SAYING! sorry. nik brought it up and well i will nevee shy away from ths oppertunity to shit on proshippers"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZsMGRTbZ1LeZ0m00", "note_count": 10, "body": "ok btw is it just me or are there like a lot of proshippers and proshipper apologists in the dsmp fandom lol"}, {"blog_name": "adhdengland-blog", "id": 144291507525, "date": "2016-05-13 10:04:30 GMT", "timestamp": 1463133870, "tags": ["small.txt", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZICm3h26OSQr5", "note_count": 3, "body": "so i didn't think i'd have to talk about this but here we are. i said that i don't use neopronouns back when i had the blog \"egnlnad\", because i didn't know how to use them. now i've researched more into them and have tried harder to understand and use them. at this point in time, i can (kind of) use fae pronouns, and have a grasp of nounself pronouns. i use kit/kits pronouns because i feel as though he/she/it/they aren't always accurate to my gender identity, as i'm aquarigender. as of now i typically use people's auxiliary pronouns. i was unaware glxwingdeathclaw (i am using your url in this post because it is a response to a post which contained my and abel's urls) had changed void about, and still thought voi exclusively used voi/void and it/its pronouns. as of right now my \"main\" pronouns are still my auxiliary (\"he/him\") but i encourage the use of \"kit/kits\" for myself as i want to know how i feel about using them. that being said i think it's important to use auxiliary pronouns for those who don't feel comfortable or confident using them, and it's almost borderline ableist & xenophobic to not have them already available. it belittles people with anxiety and/or paranoia who are not comfortable asking, and people from other countries whose first language is not able to support neo- or nounself pronouns, such as german.\n(ps. i do care for others with paranoia, and how much i do or don't should not dictate whether i have paranoia or not anyway, i have done nothing against others with paranoia EXCEPT glxwingdeathclaw, who has also shown no respect for my own paranoia, even speculating it is fake.)"}, {"blog_name": "e-has", "id": 654851860411318272, "date": "2021-06-24 06:16:40 GMT", "timestamp": 1624515400, "tags": ["capitalism", "discourse", "politics", "USA", "socialism", "jeff bezoz", "amazon", "capitol", "blm", "poverty", "economics"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZnHJxXaMW4meKW00", "note_count": 0, "body": "The smartest thing the rich man ever did was convince the poor man that his fellow co-worker, who labored for his meal just as he did, was indeed more lazy than himself, who allows his money and corruption to labor for him.

That is what I normally see it on and you know what that's okay, I'm cool if you have your own little headcanon and all that, but what I don't like is, personally I feel when you say \"sorry I don't make the rules\" it basically means like \"hey here's a headcanon you can't have any other fucking opinion about it\" and like I mean it's cool that's your headcanon my man but like other people have their own headcanons and I've seen countless times on Tumblr where people would have their own little headcanons and then they would get attacked for it like.. are you serious right now? You're going to attack somebody for having their own little opinion about (fictional character)?\n\n\nLike here's an example; I drew a picture of breath of the wild link and I did it to draw out my headcanons for this character. Now I was really proud of this drawing and I posted it on here and you know a lot of people were reblogged and they were like all \"this really cute\" and all that.\n\nHowever I did get comments that were like \"this is fucking disgusting\" and \"go kill yourself for drawing this\" and all I did was headcanon link as trans and chubby. Now, what makes both of those  things bad? holy shit I gave him these headcanons cuz this is a character I'm kin with and he was also a character that I've always looked up to as a child. I just gave him qualities about myself that made me feel comfortable more confident about myself, with being trans and fat. But as soon as it came about the fat thing people would get angry and they were being really fatphobic about it. And this is what ties in with \"I'm sorry I don't make the rules\" and it really does piss me off because someone messaged me and they were like \"links not fat sorry I don't make the rules.\" This was awhile ago keep in mind so I don't really have asked anymore because I blocked the person, but we ended up in a really long argument over it and I was like \"look if you don't have this headcanon there was no need for you to say go kill yourself on my post or that it was disgusting.\" I get it, other people have their own little tastes and things but that doesn't mean you need to be a fucking cunt about it. Yes, people have their own headcanons. Yes, not a lot of people are going to like them, a lot of people are going to have their own little things about it. That's fine , however you do not need to be a total douche nugget about it. It's that simple. like I'm making this post because it's just something that I've thought about and this is a personal blog as well as my art blog and I'm sorry if you don't want to see this but I wanted to make a point about it. This really does piss me off what I'm saying is you can have your own little headcanons all I'm saying is don't fucking go to somebody's blog and tell them to go fucking kill themselves or that their art is disgusting because they had their own little headcanons, unless that headcanon is specifically made to hurt somebody like making a character white when they're black, you know that's something I would be a little bit mad about, but when somebody has little headcanons like this characters fat because it makes me feel comfortable or because they like it because it's cute for this character or it's really fitting, that does not give you an excuse to leave hate in their inbox. It is 2017 learn how to grow up because that's what I had to do. When you sit and look at what you're doing you're going to see you're hurting a lot of people. Take the time to stay away from your computer do something else if you don't like something you saw, don't leave hate in somebody's inbox.\n\nLong story short;\n\nGrow up."}, {"blog_name": "apileofmoss", "id": 680921563789459456, "date": "2022-04-08 00:23:26 GMT", "timestamp": 1649377406, "tags": ["discourse", "kinda"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZQK4nWbp7etvam00", "note_count": 4, "body": "rb to blow up mysoginistic streamers <3"}, {"blog_name": "introvert-celeste", "id": 176005987381, "date": "2018-07-18 02:10:54 GMT", "timestamp": 1531879854, "tags": ["discourse", "not tagging", "is it so hard to make your own damn post instead of jumping on mine?"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0d74f2ZwnZmr", "note_count": 22, "body": "That wasn\u2019t even the first crit I\u2019ve had to block because they reblogged that specific post ffs\nI\u2019ve never had a big problem with crits reblogging my posts with their shit opinions before.

It was my first ship in the Voltron fandom and my first Voltron Klance fic\n Bonding Time \nis still my most popular. But it\u2019s a constant frustration, because the more Klance content I reblog, the more anti blogs and art and posts are recommended to me. Because so many Klance fans are antis, and so Klance is associated with antis, which is so sad because I don\u2019t want to be associated with such a toxic side of a fandom and I know many other Klance shippers don\u2019t either, or don\u2019t see the harm in anti arguments because they support Klance, and they\u2019re defending Klance, so it must be okay, right? I hate that so many antis who ship Klance are also Lance stans, because I love Lance but I do not appreciate the iterations of Klance which make Keith out to be little more than a prop to support and lavish love upon Lance when he needs it - forget Keith\u2019s feelings and character development, he\u2019s from Texas and loves knives and making terrible decisions LOL. I hate the\u00a0\u201cthere can only be one\u201d mentality among so many Klance fans, who will go out of their way to bash other ships in order to make Klance the only\u00a0\u201csafe\u201d and\u00a0\u201cnon-problematic\u201d one. I hate that the argument\u00a0\u201cbecause it\u2019s not Klance\u201d has literally been used when one shipper was asked why she didn\u2019t ship or like Hance, I hate that people label Pidge/Lance as problematic even though Pidge and Lance have great potential as a couple and their age difference is the same as Keith and Lance\u2019s, and most of all I hate that antis who ship Klance (...which is most if not all of them) claim other ships that\u00a0\u201cinterfere\u201d with Klance like Sheith or Shance or Shklance are pedophilia and unhealthy, when they are neither. I hate that antis who ship Klance will go so far as to attack other shippers with slews of hate, death threats, give them labels using words they do not even understand, and worst of all invalidate the experiences and trauma of actual CSA victims in their quest to make Klance the one true pairing. I hate that Klance fans have attacked the creators and voice actors of the show in the same way, I hate that \n@bext-k\n has been treated so horribly here on tumblr and then been told she couldn\u2019t defend herself because her bully was a minor (a minor, but not a toddler, someone who is perfectly capable of not being an asshole and whose age does not make it okay for them to say the things they said). I cannot stand the Klance meta posts that analyze the heck out of every interaction between the two of them, and at the same time ignore much more meaningful interactions between characters like Shiro and Keith and deny that there could be anything more than friendship between them. It isn\u2019t that deep, I\u2019m sorry, it just isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s embarrassing to see how far of a reach Klance fans make sometimes in order to make their ship as canon as possible. And look, to a degree, I get it. I love Klance. But I do not love the way so many Klance shippers have broken apart this fandom and created spaces so toxic that CSA victims\u2019 voices cannot even be heard without being shut down, mocked, and insulted. I do not love the way I now I have to check every unknown blog\u2019s description before reblogging a post from them to make sure they don\u2019t say \u201cshaladins get out\u201d or \u201cstinky anti\u201d there. I do not love the way that adult antis claim they are protecting minors and then turn around and reblog nsfw fanart of Keith and Lance, two characters who they apparently see as minors, even going so far as to tag it with things like \u201cyaoi\u201d or \u201cthis is so sinful\u201d or something equally insulting. I do not love the way antis gaslight and guilt-trip, I do not love the insidious mob mentality that leads to people feeling afraid of not thinking the way other antis do. I do not love the all too prevalent fujoshi culture found among Klance shippers - have you ever noticed that the overwhelming majority of Klance shippers are teenage to twenty-something girls? Whereas all of the queer guys I know of in this fandom are multishippers and/or ship Sheith or Shance. Why don\u2019t we acknowledge that? Why don\u2019t we acknowledge that queer guys, whose relationships we are writing/drawing/analyzing and fangirling about, have an opinion here, and that their opinion maybe, just MAYBE, matters more than ours? In Hypable\u2019s Battleships poll, this was literally proven - way more guys voted for Sheith than voted for Klance. But \nSheith\n is the toxic relationship. Uh-huh. Right. Okay. Even though they're both adults and have shown each other nothing but love, trust, and respect. This is what infuriates me about so many Klance shippers. The willful blindness to even acknowledge that other sides, other ships, may have merit. And of course this isn\u2019t all of them, I ship Klance and I know many others who do and who don\u2019t share this mentality that makes me so sad and upset. But there are a significant amount of Klance shippers who do. Why can\u2019t there just be a dialogue? Why can\u2019t antis be people who may not like Shaladin ships but understand that this is a fictional show, people are entitled to their opinions, blacklisting tags/blocking users/not looking at content you don\u2019t like is a valid option, and words like pedophilia and\u00a0\u201cgo kill yourself\u201d should not be thrown around as lightly and frequently as they are? I wish we could. I really wish we could. And I also wish I could ship Klance as much as I want to without constantly being reminded of all the hate spread by people who call it their OTP.\nme: \nyep haha ofc klance will always be close to my heart!"}, {"blog_name": "radfemstarbucks-blog", "id": 157866480021, "date": "2017-03-01 16:35:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1488386128, "tags": ["discourse", "/confrontation", "chalupa777"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZXk5ge2J1ar6L", "note_count": 1, "body": "C\u2019mon \n@chalupa777\n, you can get a little bit more creative than just some dick pics and some lame ableism.

Ya'll are ragging one of the only Queer VAs in voltron because she didn't give you everything, as if she had the power to change Loaquim and Lauren's writing, art direction or animation on the show, as if her suggestion to horn in something was more than just a fucking suggestion. In the end, this is a straight story with straight people running the show.  Of course the rep was going to be tacked on and not as genuine as you wanted.  Shiro is still alive and Gay and is fucking a lot more than what would have gotten if Bex decided to stay silent to spite you. Its Herculean to get something like a character being canonically queer approved.  Ya'll act as if it could have been easy.   Whats getting me mad is how hard you want to rag on the few queer people in the industry who already fight so fucking hard to break the glass ceiling on representation.  If you really think its easy pitching a show you want  to the old white straight men who run Dreamworks then fuck me where are the queer stories?  None of ya'll getting your fix from Rebecca Sugar who is an lgbtq creator fighting to stay on Cartoon Network.  At least, not enough of you- especially the ones that wanted Queer rep but it was code for \"Klance becomes Canon\".  I'm apalled that you would spit on her like this, basically saying the representation wasn't enough for you, despite how fucking hard it is to get at least one queer living character in the show.  \nYa'll were pampered with Steven Universe, thinking it was easy to just get a show on Netflix with legitimate lgbtq rep, that lgbtq rep is easy to get approved by straight old men with their straight old stories.  \nI was queerbaited by Supernatural.  I am still mad about it.  I can and will pull up my rants about Destiel being Canon King because I was so excited, so hopeful that I'd get the Queer representation I wanted.  It still hurts me to think that there is still a part of me that believes Dean and Cas will admit their love for each other.  So, I get it- being upset that a show teasing two characters going together doesn't follow through.  \nExcept VLD's subtext never frames  Klance as a ship tease in the first place.  \"We make a Good Team.  The Bonding Moment.  We Need To Talk.\" Keith and Lance don't bounce off of each other as easily as they could in any of those scenes.  At best they are a pretty cool colleague work relationship, at worst they are essentially strangers.  Lance calling Keith The Future holds no ship tease material because neither of them share a camera framed moment about how touching saying something like that could be. \nI'd love to have something like Klance be canon, you know- for ya'll, stripping the meta to its barebones Superntural style and having most of your frame by frame analysis be right.  \nSeeing you all cancel Bex Taylor Klaus because she either didn't fight hard enough on your ship, or didn't fight hard enough on Shiro's queerness or Adam being alive or Zethrid and Ezor being alive is so fucking disingenuous.  She's a VA, not a director, or a writer or an animator or anything but a voice actor.  Seeing you all do this is so disingenous and I hate to think that in the end, ya'll don't really care about hard it is for a VA to basically beg to directors and then beg to executive producers on making a character or two or three queer.  \nIn the end, ya'll dont know Queerbait, and it pisses me the fuck off when people call Voltron Legendary Defender a show that Queerbaits.  Because it doesn't fucking queerbait.  Supernatural queerbaits and Sherlock queerbaits.      \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "defectivegembrain", "id": 164011675097, "date": "2017-08-10 04:58:52 GMT", "timestamp": 1502341132, "tags": ["discourse", "social justice"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZUhKxu2OlsutP", "note_count": 4, "body": "\"that issue isn't important because this one is bigger!\" did u know that it's possible to care about multiple things actually i think that's something most people do "}, {"blog_name": "sunfoxfic", "id": 667340316315123712, "date": "2021-11-09 02:35:19 GMT", "timestamp": 1636425319, "tags": ["anyway if you call someone an abuse apologist over a theory then you're a bad person", "rambles", "discourse", "salt"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZZOOaTb2tdjYGe00", "note_count": 10, "body": "my drafts is the burial ground for posts that I thought were too mean to be posted"}, {"blog_name": "armve1ns", "id": 180523778994, "date": "2018-11-26 18:29:23 GMT", "timestamp": 1543256963, "tags": ["discourse", "actuallyftm", "transmed", "gender dysphoria", "medical", "personal", "hormone replacement therapy"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZNk0-X2e83aEo", "note_count": 0, "body": "What I consider myself to be, and a brief explanation of why:\nSocially: \nmale\n.

I might fall into that category of people as well and here\u2019s why;\n1) \nSaeran/Ray\u2019s mental state of mind\n; First let me make this very clear and state that this has nothing to do with the stigma of a character having a mental illness (especially since the entire RFA display symptoms of one mental illness or another) but the fact that this boy isn\u2019t in an unaltered state of mind, as in that he\u2019s under the influence. So romancing him (or even \nthinking\n about that prospect for that matter) to many of us would practically feel akin to a person trying to woo a drunk person in a bar, since Ray is in a very vulnerable state of mind on those drugs. After those drugs are pumped out of him, however, that\u2019s a completely different story...\n2) Something a lot of people tend to overlook, \nSeven\u2019s Bad Ending 1\n. Yes, that is the ending where Seven is unable to rescue the MC and Saeran ends up abducting her. Well after that...he ends up torturing her while taking pictures of himself doing so and after that he implied rapes her. Even though the torture and taking pictures were to get back at his brother he was brainwashed to hate, the rape was clearly his own decision and was committed without any external coercion but his own.\nWhile some might say that the bad endings aren\u2019t canon, I\u2019d like to argue that they\u2019re definitely canon alternatives and inform the audiences of the consequences of their \u2018bad\u2019 decisions. Rape is one moral event horizon crossed that often indicates that the person being assaulted should never look at their assaulter as anything but a perpetrator, no matter how horrible their backstory might be (especially since many rapists tend to be victims of rape themselves and sometimes guilt trip their partner into forgiving them after they\u2019ve committed the assault). While some might argue that Saeran as Ray hadn\u2019t committed assault in any of the alternative endings in another story, I would like to state that the very implication that he\u2019s somehow capable of committing such a heinous act might leave some players a little queasy when it comes to seeing him as a romantic option (especially those who might be victims themselves).\nWith that said, I would like to conclude that even though Saeran committed crimes that were well outside the realm of him being brainwashed (such as trying to blind Yoosung without no aforementioned reason but to \u2018end\u2019 his dreams and what he\u2019d done to MC off-screen), I believe with all my heart that the sweet and innocent child his brother talked about remembering was heartbreakingly wronged with the chances of a normal life being stripped away from him. Making sure that we get see the boy who was horribly wronged be at his happiest best is why I\u2019m absolutely grateful to Cheritz for providing us all with a Saeran/Ray route. I would also like to advise that people who do find it uncomfortable romancing Saeran like me to abstain from shaming those who are excited to romance him within the otome game. I would also like the courtesy to be returned vice-versa; differing opinions should never justify rudeness and disrespect."}, {"blog_name": "rennyrosie", "id": 158994250164, "date": "2017-03-30 07:15:17 GMT", "timestamp": 1490858117, "tags": ["rosie talks sometimes", "q slur //", "discourse", "i'm sorry", "apology note", "this is surprisingly coherent for how blurry my mind has been all day and night"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZQMFZi2K4oxcq", "note_count": 1, "body": "So it seems I\u2019ve put my foot in my mouth a few times.

He and I have lived different lives but our upbringings were not all that dissimilar. My uncle, his father, grew up with the liberal values of my grandparents just as my parents did; we have both gone to good schools, had exposure to diverse urban areas, and had access to a variety of media and books. \nWhen I was 14 in high school, one of my friends came out as trans. I had never heard of transgender people before, had only learned what it meant to be gay in the past year or two, and knew nothing about gender transition; the only info I had was basically \u201c[Jake] wants to be a boy now and he\u2019s going by different pronouns.\u201d \nThat information was enough for me to think, firstly, \u201cWell, this doesn\u2019t seem to be harming anyone. I guess I will respect Jake\u2019s wishes until I know more.\u201d I was 14. This basic ethical intuition is NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.\u00a0\nIt was also enough for me to think, \u201cI need to learn more about this; I\u2019ve never heard of this before.\u201d Again, this was high school, so this meant cherrypicking every episode of Degrassi with that one trans character in it (which quickly turned into \u201cmooning over that one trans character in Degrassi constantly\u201d), and watching videos made by trans people on YouTube. (I did eventually branch out to reading scholarly writing on the topic of transition and learning about scientific consensus on it.)\nThe point I\u2019m making here is: This happened when I was a 14-year-old idiot in high school. No adults came to my health class and told me what to think about Jake\u2019s transition \u2013 in fact, most of the adults in my life didn\u2019t support it. I had little in the way of formal resources to educate myself. I basically had one trans character represented in media, the writing of a few more trans people I found online, and some basic ethical ideas about how other people deserve respect, the golden rule, stuff you can learn from Disney movies. I was still -- easily -- able to find everything I needed to make basic decisions about how to treat Jake. I had learned in kindergarten that we are supposed to be kind to other people and respect their wishes as long as their wishes aren\u2019t disrespectful to us. I had the ability to critically evaluate the opinions of bigots online instead of immediately accepting them, and to find second and third opinions if their ideas seemed harmful. I came to the conclusion that trans people deserve dignity and respect and immediately acted on that conclusion by switching the name and pronouns I used for my trans friend. \nPeople seem to forget this when they\u2019re talking to me about my transition \u2013 they\u2019ll make a big deal about how hard it is to switch pronouns for me and imply that because I\u2019m seeing my transition from the inside, I have no idea what it\u2019s like on the outside; they tell me that people need time to \u201ccome around\u201d to my transition, that it\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d that people are initially revolted or against it, that I shouldn\u2019t be surprised when people express their shitty opinions to me because they don\u2019t know any better.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s total bullshit and it infuriates me. I\u2019ve had like five or six friends who have transitioned, changed names, and changed pronouns since Jake. I\u2019ve gone through this from the other side and I \nknow how easy it is not to be a transphobe,\n\u00a0to keep that crappy opinion to yourself until you can find out what actual doctors and sociologists say about the phenomenon.\u00a0I didn\u2019t have a problem with my friend transitioning when I was 14, before I knew what trans was much less that I was trans myself, and I\u2019m seriously supposed to believe that you, as a full-grown adult with far more resources than I had at the time, are somehow incapable of making these connections? That being an ethical adult is so hard for you that you actually can\u2019t do it and need more time, when as a depressed, completely dysfunctional 14-year-old, I was able to figure it out? I was a smart kid, but not \nthat\n\u00a0smart.\nThe whole idea is bullshit. It\u2019s a shitty excuse for the poor behavior of adults and their \nchoice \nnot to respect me when what I\u2019m doing is harmless and has in fact benefited those around me by making me a happier person to be around with far more energy to share with others.\nSo, my cousin \u2013 who, again, is nearing 30 \u2013 has made these rude insinuations, and my family started in on excuses for him. At one point, I was discussing this with my mom, pointing out that if he had thought about it for a moment, he would have realized that my transition is a medical issue* that he has no real right to comment on, because everyone knows that medical procedures (especially those involving one\u2019s sex characteristics!) are private and not a topic of discussion. Her response was, \u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t \nrealize\n it\u2019s a medical issue.\u201d\nYeah, I know, he doesn\u2019t. But why doesn\u2019t he? It\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t bothered to look up a single article written by a medical professional on the subject. It\u2019s because, out of all the trans-101 books at his local library that explain the necessity of transition, he has chosen not to read any of them \u2013 and decided to give me his uninformed opinion on the topic from that basis of zero information. It\u2019s because the source he did choose to read on the topic was a virulent transphobe with no empirical support, and he apparently didn\u2019t bother to find that out about the author, or to look for any sources from the other side, or to critically evaluate what he was reading and wonder who it benefited, who it hurt, who had incentive to give him those views.\nIf I, as a 14-year-old, had the resources to realize being trans is a medical issue deserving of respect, what right does a grown adult have to tell me that they disrespected me because they couldn\u2019t figure it out? \nThe information is out there. \nThe medical consensus has been reached by doctors and psychologists worldwide that transition is healthy and necessary for trans people. Scores of new papers on the subject have come out since I was 14; this information is more easily accessible than ever. Why am I supposed to let him off the hook for this when this kind of mistake is \nso easy to avoid?\n\u00a0\nWhy should his ignorance be an excuse? How come he gets a free pass as a grown adult, surrounded by resources he can use to educate himself with, while I, as a 14-year-old, got no credit for coming to the correct ethical conclusion that enabled me to respect my friend and make what were probably some of the hardest years of his life a little less horrible? Why am I supposed to believe that this was an unavoidable, innocent ethical mistake on the part of my cousin, when as a \nchild\n, I was able to figure out how serious this issue was for my friend who was transitioning, to go out and educate myself, and perhaps more importantly, \nbefore\n\u00a0I had any education on the topic, make the easy, natural choice to respect his wishes even before I understood them?\nWhy does everyone keep asking me to believe that the majority of the world can\u2019t figure this out and I should be patient with them because they can\u2019t help hurting people like me, when all they really need is a tiny bit of empathy to realize that what they\u2019re doing is wrong?\n* Obvious disclaimer that not every trans person sees their transition as a medical issue, etc. \u2013 what I mean here is that I am medically transitioning and like any other medication or surgery I go through, it\u2019s inappropriate for family to be commenting on whether it\u2019s a good idea or not without a very good reason or a medical degree."}, {"blog_name": "scissorman", "id": 164732474549, "date": "2017-08-29 01:29:59 GMT", "timestamp": 1503970199, "tags": ["this is aimed at several types of people so i'm not gonna name names", "discourse", "noel.rtf"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zgz-ms2PQqXIr", "note_count": 0, "body": "Controversial opinion: if you make a post and go snooping through the tags on the reblogs, \nyou\n are responsible if you see something that you don't like, not the person who wrote the tags on \ntheir\n own blog.

Yes, she pushed her children, but she never intentionally abused them like Cordelia, and deep down, she did love them, she just found it awkward to express her feelings for them. Her personality did closely resemble Reiji\u2019s while Shu inherited her looks.\n\n\nBeatrix was cruelly tormented by Cordelia and lived under immense pressure because of her.

It\u2019s not like she (or Christa) had any experience with raising kids, and yet all some people want to do is whine and b*tch about how they\u2019re so mean and unfair to their kids because they didn\u2019t let them have what they want. Those people should try to have kids themselves, while being in an environment where they have enormous shoes to fill as their father\u2019s sons, while dealing with a tormentor who viciously compares her children to theirs to make them feel inadequate, and see how well of a 'fun\u2019 parent they can be.\u00a0\n\n\nI also see Christa get the same treatment and actually be called a 'raggedy ass hoe\u2019 and a 'trick ass b*tch'\u00a0(no, I didn\u2019t make that phrase up, somebody\u00a0\nactually\n\u00a0referred to her as that in a post \u2013 I\u2019m not joking).

Lance kind of sets off some alarm bells at the back of my brain that got set up a long time ago, back in middle school. Many of the bullies I\u2019ve dealt with in my life have been a lot like him in terms of outward personality: outgoing, popular, overly friendly, no sense of formality or personal space, etc. His character, as charming as he is, just does not click with me, which kind of invokes a serious sense of confusion when faced with the number of super aggressive Lance stans on this site. He\u2019s not really especially good-looking, his quirks aren\u2019t sorta contradictory to add interest, and he\u2019s pretty immature, so what\u2019s the big deal?\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a principle in fandom that states that the most popular ship in any given fandom consists of the two local skinny white boys, often going to bizarre lengths to appease this appetite for this variety of ship, ranging from importing them from other fandoms to even shipping the character with himself. I think a similar thing is happening with the Klancers, in which the only real subversion is their ethnicities don\u2019t match the usual requirements for this trend (though their skin tones are light enough that those fans can ignore it).\nAs far as I have seen, Lance stans have been perhaps the biggest problem in the fandom in terms of both harassment and oversaturation of media. I\u2019m not saying that making a ton of fanworks for your favorite character is a bad thing, but the sheer pervasiveness of Lance content compared to any other character is just ludicrous. Lance is in over 32 thousand fics on Archive of Our Own, second only to Keith\u2019s 34 thousand, who I\u2019ll get to later.\u00a0\nBut again, the real issue is the aggression. Accusations of pedophilia and condoning abuse, suicide baiting, spreading malicious information, harassing family members of the VLD crew, sending death threats, and even a fucking Kickstarter campaign to pay a deep web hitman to kill Lauren Montgomery. Jesus Christ on a fucking pennywise, what the actual hell is wrong with these people? Something to note, one of the people working on the She Ra reboot is, in fact, a Klanti and aggressive Lance stan, who\u2019s retweeted those tweets calling for an assassination campaign.\nI think somebody needs to start pressing charges because this is not okay! Somebody needs to call the cops and get these twerps in jail for death threats and stalking, because that is what they're doing, and they need to know that actions have consequences. Maybe alert the aforementioned storyboard artist or whatever\u2019s employers of the kind of shit she\u2019s been pulling.\nKeith. Keith also sets off alarm bells, but for vastly different reasons than Lance. He just feels like the kind of person you need to walk on eggshells around, but can\u2019t really fix that because of deep-seated issues, which is a personality type I\u2019m not too comfortable around. I don\u2019t like overly angsty characters for this reason; the feel too hostile to safely navigate.\nThat said, to me, he\u2019s a far more appealing character than Lance. I can actually get his struggle with socialization and stuff, and he\u2019s perhaps part of why I originally started watching the show (more specifically the original Galra Keith theory). However, it irks me just how much content is loaded with him, primarily alongside Lance. He\u2019s borderline inescapable, and I don\u2019t think that should be a point of pride for any fan. Inescapability tends to turn that thing you like into a prison.\nShiro. I like Shiro. I don\u2019t like how flippant and trollish the writers are in regards to him or his fate, but a good thing to keep in mind when watching VLD is this:\nDo not think of Voltron: Legendary Defender as its own independent series, but as an affectionate mashup parody of Voltron: Defenders of The Universe, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Golion.\nThey do not see this series as equal to their previous works, nor as equal to more original works. This is basically fanfiction of an 80s show crossed over with elements from their own original work mixed in. Of course, they\u2019re not going to take Shiro seriously, because he\u2019s based on this minor character who died at the beginning of the original work. Whether they gave him a tragic backstory or not doesn\u2019t change the fact that they do not see making original content as any more important than making their recreation of DOTU, no matter how shitty it looks to new viewers.\nI think this rule is evident in their treatment of Lotor\u2019s situation as well; they don\u2019t really care about making him new and interesting, only in eventually making him into a parody of DOTU Lotor. They don\u2019t care about the characters, or even really the setting, nearly as much as they care about mimicking the original show, for better or worse.\nI don\u2019t like their coding with Lotor\u2019s situation; I don\u2019t like how their lesson regarding him is that abused children will eventually turn out just like their parents, or that a mixed race person does not belong to either of their parents\u2019 peoples. I don\u2019t like how they shirked both Keith\u2019s and Shiro\u2019s character development just to get Keith in the Black Lion like in the original series. I don\u2019t like how they\u2019re seemingly going to give Allura to Lance as a reward for his heroism or some bullshit like that, regardless of her lack of interest in him. I don\u2019t like how they keep going back and forth with portraying the Galra as a people or just an evil force.\u00a0\nBut it makes sense if you treat it like a mashup fic. In the original series, Lotor/Sincline was born evil, no matter his complicated situation. In the original series, most of the characters were very flat and stereotypical. In the original series, Allura being treated like shit due to being a girl was something to be amused by. In the original series, the Galra weren\u2019t that complicated until they involved Dairugger XV (I think that\u2019s how it\u2019s spelled).\nShitty writing aside, it still doesn\u2019t justify the utterly inhumane and dubiously legal antics of the antis.

Okay.\nAll right, so apparently I brought flaming paper bags to my front porch with this one.\nThat personal little commentary I wrote on my personal opinion of inappropriate crit in fics has apparently become a\n thing. \nAnd honestly I\u2019m a little stunned.\u00a0 In no small part because there is \nactually\n a contingent of people who feel it\u2019s completely appropriate to leave critical commentary if there\u2019s no author\u2019s note from the \u201csensitive writer who doesn\u2019t want to get better\u201d asking them not to, but also because I\u2019ve been dragged into this mess on a person post expressing my personal dissatisfaction and trying--very calmly, I thought (at the time)--to discourage people from leaving those comments.\u00a0 So I sort of feel like I should break it down a bit more and hopefully this thing can \nstop\n being a thing?\nLike I said in my original post: It was, overall, a very nice comment. Even the crit was phrased nicely. However, it \nwasn\u2019t asked for.\n I didn\u2019t know the commenter and had no idea how to respond to someone who felt it necessary to say, (literally) \u201cThis is what I didn\u2019t like about your fic.\u201d It\u2019s not that their comment made me feel like it was bad--I had a flash of that before I righted myself; I\u2019m a decent writer--but I felt more... shaken at the idea that someone felt that saying that--\neven in a nice way\n--was okay.\u00a0 How do they know what motivates me as a writer?\u00a0 How do they know that this tiny, three lined crit in the middle of a fantastic comment, isn\u2019t going to discourage me from posting?\u00a0 \nI keep hearing, \u201cWell, what if the writer wants to get better!\u00a0\n I \nwant to get better! That\u2019s how people learn!\u201dand the only thing I keep thinking is, \nwho gets to decide that?\n That the writer shouldn\u2019t be \nperfectly happy \nwith their work just because a reader doesn\u2019t like it or even if it\u2019s riddled with technical flaws?\u00a0 Why is it \nyour \nresponsibility to inform them that you think they should improve upon their stories?\u00a0 Why not wait for them to say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m looking to improve this skill, can anyone help me?\u201d or write in their author\u2019s note that concrit is encouraged?\nAnother person brought up that writing is, oftentimes, just a hobby, and people aren\u2019t necessarily looking to improve. While this is true, and certainly something to take in to consideration, even writers who take their works more seriously are not always (or even often) going to be encouraged by someone saying, \u201cthis was okay, BUT...\u201d I, personally, am not going to go flush with happiness just because it\u2019s bracketed by praise.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think this makes me too sensitive to get better. I have beta readers and friends I trust, who know how to be encouraging while also spotting flaws.\u00a0 I have \nlooked for\n these people. It was a \nchoice\n I made to hear their criticisms. That is significant, I think\nThis isn\u2019t about hurt feelings.\u00a0 Well, not mine (although it\u2019d be dishonest to say I didn\u2019t have a moment, but--). It\u2019s about having respect for the artists who create things and display them for your (hopeful) enjoyment. It literally takes \nno effort\n to not comment.\u00a0 And if you\u2019re determined to, please keep in mind that you don\u2019t know the writer (if indeed you don\u2019t), and don\u2019t know where their headspace is, don\u2019t know what kind of affect your concrit will have on them.\u00a0 It could be fine. It could be... not good.\u00a0 And I\u2019d rather be safe, because I would hate feeling like another writer could potentially be discouraged by \nanything I could say.\nNow, in regards to my last post: I cannot say how much I appreciate the outpouring of support.\u00a0 It is so kind of all of you who have written me asks and contacted me about this. I\u2019m okay. I feel a little bad that my original post seems to have read as someone who was really, genuinely hurt over the matter.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be more careful next time when writing something in this vein (if I ever have the courage to do so again. lol)."}, {"blog_name": "aspirationatwork", "id": 645405267795836928, "date": "2021-03-11 23:47:07 GMT", "timestamp": 1615506427, "tags": ["i could say so much more about this but im having trouble enunciating it and i already got my point across", "this is not directed at the actually nice people who respect trans and nonbinary folk", "discourse", "lgbt discourse", "trans discourse", "nonbinary discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zc2XeVZqyAlh8m00", "note_count": 35, "body": "The trans double standard is absolutely ridiculous.\nIn one breath people will say \"if you don't dress masculine/feminine/androgynous you aren't really trans/nonbinary.\"\nAnd then turn around and say \"dressing masculine/feminine/androgynous doesn't make you trans/nonbinary.\"\nFirstly, trans and nonbinary folk don't owe you shit.

i\u2019m not listening to your opinion on him or his personality or looks if you don\u2019t watch him because that\u2019s entirely unfair sorry. also, i don\u2019t care that he has simps i don\u2019t care that for the larger part he\u2019s considered attractive because that doesn\u2019t change my point, my point is don\u2019t do this to anyone. things have gotten so much better over the course of a year but this is entirely reminiscent of times people felt fully entitled to openly call george boring and compare his personality to cardboard and call him the worst dream team member only namely bringing him up for his appearance and then people heavily criticising THAT too. have some compassion don\u2019t compare someone\u2019s LOOKS to someone else\u2019s and tie their entire worth to that, be normal who cares if he\u2019s just some guy we\u2019re all just some guy? everyone is just Some Guy and that\u2019s literally okay\nif you don\u2019t \nget \nwhy\n \ngeorge is attractive maybe you just have different taste and thats actually completely normal! and okay honestly!! but speaking on it and being ridiculously rude and fostering an environment of negativity about someone\u2019s appearance of all things is very dislikable to me and i\u2019m tired of people making genuinely rude jokes at his expense when they don\u2019t care about him as a content creator and have such a surface level understanding of him and what he has to offer you don\u2019t see me in any creators business you don\u2019t see me tearing down peoples content, their efforts, \ntheir\n appearance because i\u2019m a normal person and it simply is just cruel"}, {"blog_name": "pieuvrecakes", "id": 156909641827, "date": "2017-02-06 23:57:19 GMT", "timestamp": 1486425439, "tags": ["discourse", "the idea that non-hetero conforming people haven't suffered and shouldn't band together is bad", "and you should feel bad"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z4uJmv2I8Yo1Z", "note_count": 1, "body": "so Tired of seeing exclusionist discourse on my dash.

Hollywood is slowly (painfully slowly) making small steps to fill the void and we\u2019ve got impatient of waiting. An unfortunate side effect to this is that fans are pushing for it through fandom, which has lead to the sexualisation and fetishisation of male friendships (especially those who display any amount of platonic intimacy, something that media is also lacking in is male friendships that aren\u2019t built on toxic masculinity).\nWhat people don\u2019t seem to get, but something that Anthony Mackie does, is that Hollywood is exploiting this because it is less risk for them. If they only need to use some suggestive lines and change some camera angles to get the same effect in fan communities as introducing a fully-formed homosexual relationship then they will. Fandom\u2019s feed into the tokenism of homosexual experiences by attributing them to any male friendships that show a degree of intimacy. The sexualisation and fetishisation of non-toxic male friendship follows, which not only continues the tokenism of our homosexual relationships and experiences, but also perpetuates how toxic masculinity vs tenderness is perceived in male friendships. This isn\u2019t a case of the small, weak fandoms just doing their thing. These are very real, very important social issues; they bleed into one another. Fandom doesn\u2019t exist in a void.\nLGBT+ people deserve better, because they deserve actual representation rather than sexualised (and often fetishised) suggestion, \nwhich is exactly what he was saying\n if people actually think critically about it instead of seizing the opportunity to become enraged."}, {"blog_name": "71271f9f7a6594bd", "id": 179226724894, "date": "2018-10-20 00:00:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1539993650, "tags": ["discourse", "political commentary", "feminism"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zkwurc2cwlieU", "note_count": 0, "body": "do NOT align yourself with the \"Mario Monks\""}, {"blog_name": "ladybugs-mask", "id": 175227770426, "date": "2018-06-25 04:30:56 GMT", "timestamp": 1529901056, "tags": ["miraculous ladybug", "discourse", "im probs gonna forget about it once watching another episode lol", "its just a kids show honestly", "and astruc is french lmao hes always blunt and probably doesnt mean to come across as rude", "even though thats how most of us interpret his tweets", "but its hard to ignore this discourse muddy my view of the show", "adrien in particular", "who i already knew had flaws btw he is in no way perfect"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZvQ0nm2ZCOvOw", "note_count": 7, "body": "i didn\u2019t even think that much of astruc\u2019s tweets until getting on here and seeing all the discourse. i\u2019m gonna still enjoy the show but it\u2019s hard to not let this fandom cloud my image of my original view of the show with everyone\u2019s \u201ctwo cents\u201d\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "justroddythings", "id": 178132693869, "date": "2018-09-16 04:53:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1537073608, "tags": ["discourse", "roddy talks"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZfgvNi2bvYJDj", "note_count": 2, "body": "I DONT EVEN HEADCANON NOVA AS TRANS, BUT YKNOW WHAT????

Any teacher worth their salt will tell you that grades don\u2019t measure intelligence. Lack of intelligence can prevent getting good grades, but it\u2019s definitely not the only factor.\nWe see the members of the Golden Trio doing lots of magic. We should take what we actually see them doing to be the most accurate representation of their actual skill in magic--which means we can compare their skills to their OWL marks to see what OWL marks actually represent.\nHarry has an O (Outstanding) in Defense, and E (Exceeds Expectations) in Charms and Transfiguration.\nHermione has an E in Defense, and O in Charms and Transfiguration.\nWe\u2019re never told Ron\u2019s exact marks, but we can infer that he has an E in each of Defense, Charms, and Transfiguration based on the fact that he didn\u2019t have any Os, but he was allowed to continue at NEWT in all three of these subjects.\nWhat do we know about the three characters\u2019 magical abilities?\nWell, first of all, they\u2019re all pretty good at actually doing magic. When any of them struggles with a spell, it\u2019s Big News. Hermione is talented in an academic setting but occasionally chokes under pressure. Harry is also pretty good at magic but has a low frustration threshold: when he can\u2019t immediately grasp a spell, he tends to beat himself up in nonproductive ways. Ron seems to be the best all-around spell caster, whose main fault seems to be sometimes putting too much force behind a spell.\nIt seems like\u00a0\u201cgood at magic\u201d is what it takes to get an E at OWL. The question becomes, what puts Harry over the top in DADA, and Hermione in Charms and Transfiguration?\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that the answer is magical theory. The OWL exams clearly weight magical theory very highly. There is, after all, a substantial written portion. Neville, who (though I love my boy) we can all admit is pretty much pants at spell casting, got an E in Charms and actually passed Transfiguration. The only excuse for this is spectacular performance on the written section. We can back this up by Umbridge\u2019s claim that the DADA class would be able to achieve passing marks having \nonly\n\u00a0memorized theory.\nThis would explain the trio\u2019s OWL marks very well.\nHermione is the one of the three most invested in magical theory. She \nloves\n\u00a0that stuff, it fascinates her. Hermione reads magical theory in her free time. She designs magical artifacts (the DA coins, the cursed parchment). And she\u2019s articulate in explaining it, and good at writing essays. Her low DADA mark reflects her weakness in emotional magic (the Dark Arts are clearly emotional magics) and her tendency to choke under pressure: Hermione produced a written paper that deserved an O if it hadn\u2019t been accompanied by her performance on the practical.\nHarry absorbs some theory in general, but he\u2019s spent the year before OWLs literally teaching DADA, a subject in which he has an intense interest anyway. DADA is Harry\u2019s subject, it interests him (even disregarding the whole \u201cdark wizard wants to kill me\u201d thing), and he reads about it. While Harry might be haphazard on the theory of Charms and Transfiguration, he can absolutely write an insightful essay on the theory of Defense.\nAs for Ron? His intuitive grasp of magic works against him here. Ron doesn\u2019t need to read six books on the theory of summoning charms; you wave your wand, you say \nAccio\n, and you make sure it doesn\u2019t hit you in the face if it was something heavy. OWL examiners don\u2019t want you to write that on your exam paper, though, so no Outstanding for Ron. Again, Ron has an intuition into these principles, but he hasn\u2019t learned to clearly articulate them for the benefit of examiners.\nSo let\u2019s dispell the idea that Hermione\u2019s nine Os at OWL mean that she\u2019s \u201cbetter at magic\u201d than the boys. She has a more articulate grasp of the theory of magic, and that\u2019s a big part of what OWLs measure."}, {"blog_name": "alex-marie1324", "id": 175818114790, "date": "2018-07-12 16:47:31 GMT", "timestamp": 1531414051, "tags": ["discourse", "fandom", "fandom discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZGb2ud2ZlauRc", "note_count": 36, "body": "say it with me now\nevery single fandom has toxic people and toxic content but that doesn\u2019t invalidate everyone in the fandom\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "evihcra-n3rpsts1m", "id": 134425186109, "date": "2015-12-02 23:14:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1449098041, "tags": ["im not gonna type out all the urls sorry youll probably find this though", "discourse", "th anks for tagging me"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPZyQl1zCNOyz", "note_count": 3, "body": "tagged by \n@xanderverse\n !! thanks so much\n\n\nNAME: han (mist)\nNICKNAME: not really?

He is a bounty hunter who has killed unarmed and fleeing people on screen (he disintegrated those Jawas in episode 2). He worked with the Empire because they would pay him. He helped a group of violent criminals break another criminal out of prison. The only reason he helps most of the people he helps is because they can give him something in return (including the village in episode 4). He isn't a pure paragon of goodness.\nBut he obviously isn't evil either. He has his own belief system that most of you would find shady in real life (like honestly, look up how fucked up bounty hunting is).\nAlso, the furor against Dark!Din is quite funny considering that fans were complaining about people woobifying (or himbofying) Din like two weeks ago.\nFinally, if this is your first time in fandom, you may not know about people creating evil versions of their favorite characters.

Instead, you should ask them - if it\u2019s appropriate to do so! - what it was that they were upset about with the thing you just said to them. times that wouldn\u2019t be appropriate: 1. they\u2019re a random stranger you don\u2019t know, 2. you\u2019ve really really upset them and they\u2019re not in the right frame of mind to gently explain to you what you said wrong, 3. you\u2019re really upset and likely to be quite aggressive in asking.\nnot privilegesplaining:\nsomeone said\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand radio waves!\u201d\u00a0\nsomeone else in the conversation was all\u00a0\u201cI do lemme explain radio waves\u201d.\u00a0\n(this is all complicated by the internet of course. in RL if you go up to randomers and explain things they\u2019re talking about to them that\u2019s creepy at best. don\u2019t go up to randomers unless you\u2019re happy to be accused of being an eavesdropper or worse)\nprivilegesplaining (in this case mansplaining):\nsomeone who is not a man said something about radiowaves.\na man decided she needed radiowaves explained to her, despite her having never actually asked him to.\u00a0\nthe thing that makes that mansplaining is that the person-not-a-man could very easily have been more knowledgeable about radiowaves but the man decided they were less knowledgeable than him based on nothing more than unconscious bias.\u00a0\nI have probably made mistakes so like feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "solarisaster", "id": 659649340917383168, "date": "2021-08-16 05:10:34 GMT", "timestamp": 1629090634, "tags": ["discourse", "kinda", "im gonna delete this in like 5 minutes im just annoyed that some1 thinks you can not respect someones pronouns because they like dsmp lol", "dont go send them asks its not worth it\u00a0 /srs"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZNoKfVadYvIXiu00", "note_count": 16, "body": "i hope user\u00a0reigensboyfriend blocks me <3"}, {"blog_name": "exhaustedwriter132", "id": 179328117531, "date": "2018-10-22 22:51:44 GMT", "timestamp": 1540248704, "tags": ["discourse", "I'm probably gonna get attacked by an//tis but I don't even care", "I need to get this out of my chest because it's been irritating me for a while", "I'm sleep-deprived and my brain wants me to leave this negativity out of my system so I can sleep peacefully"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZZPPPZ2d0oUiR", "note_count": 9, "body": "\u00a0 Ya know, when I see discourse around fictional characters\u2019 sexual orientation...

You owe the authors that much for using their free time to write things and post them for free! If they don\u2019t get feedback, authors will lose motivation and stop posting, and you\u2019ll only have yourself to blame!\u201d\n...that\u2019s the gist of what most of them seem to be getting at, anyway. And, fine, I won\u2019t argue that those posts could be considered true, from a certain point of view. But there\u2019s something going unsaid here, and I feel it needs to be voiced.\nMore under the cut:\nIt could very well be that we need to change the culture of fanfiction, for readers to give more feedback and show more appreciation for the writers who produce content.\nBut if it\u2019s true that the readers need to change their habits, then it\u2019s doubly true for the writers because, holy shit, have you seen the crap that some of us pull?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve seen writers of popular fics hold chapters hostage, saying they won\u2019t post the next one until they get at least five reviews, then praising the readers for giving more than the required amount. Treating the act of posting or withholding chapters as a power move that makes me deeply, deeply uncomfortable.\u00a0\nAnd then there\u2019s the passive-aggressive,\u00a0\u201cI can see all these hits on the fic, but only x numbers of reviews, and it\u2019s just so discouraging, you know? If every reader reviewed, this would be one of the most reviewed fics in the fandom!\u201d Again, holding the power of authorship over the readers\u2019 heads. My mind translates such sentiments as, \u201cI can see you out there, reading but not reviewing, you ungrateful scum.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like... you remember the Purge episode of Rick and Morty? Where the guy wanted Morty to listen to his screenplay, demanded that Morty give constructive criticism, then immediately turned on him for a fairly innocuous comment? I\u2019ve rarely seen two different people with the same definition of\u00a0\u2018constructive criticism\u2019 and that adds a level of uncertainly to commenting for such purposes.\u00a0\nWhat does the author consider\u00a0\u2018constructive criticism\u2019? Pointing out typos? Noting OOC moments? Advice on composition and story-building? At times, it can feel like playing high-stakes minesweeper. I\u2019ve definitely seen authors cancel fics over a comment they considered to have\u00a0\u2018crossed a line,\u2019 leaving the story unfinished because of the actions of a single person, often one who didn\u2019t even like the fic in the first place.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like that Philip K. Dick quote. You remember the one?\u00a0\u201cFor every person there exists a series of words that has the power to destroy you\u201d?\nWell, I can tell you, anyone who\u2019s read fanfiction for any length of time has their own version.\u00a0\u201cFor every fic, there exists a comment which will cause the author to cancel the story and then blame you.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s understandable that some people would rather play it safe and not comment than risk authorial wrath by saying the wrong thing, or worse, by having their words be misinterpreted.\nLook, I get it. I\u2019ve published more than four hundred thousand words of fanfiction, and I can understand the frustration. I know that it can be disheartening, for our fics not to get the recognition we feel they deserve... but it\u2019s never acceptable to take that frustration out on our readers.\nPeople say they want\u00a0\u2018feedback\u2019 but... from the casual reader it\u2019s a bit much, to expect everyone to give an in-depth critique of everything they read. I\u2019m sure that it would help our favorite websites if we filled out a survey on our experience every single time we used it... but said websites seem to know that such a thing would not be viable, and content themselves with usage statistics and the occasional survey.\u00a0\nIn the same way, I view detailed constructive criticism as more the realm of the beta reader, someone who\u2019s agreed to help you improve your writing and has made a commitment to do so. For the general reader, the occasional comment, favorite, or enthusiastic private message is all that can be reasonably expected... and even then, it\u2019s most certainly not an obligation.\u00a0\nI mean, in terms of raw data, just the fact that we can see the hits/favorites/followers for our stories is already a huge source of feedback, allowing us to gauge the relative popularity of our writing, to see what people read, what they don\u2019t, and to adjust our choices, going forward.\nI know not all writers are entitled assholes, just as I know not all commentators are trolls who feed on misery and human suffering. If you want to encourage your readers to comment, great! Just don\u2019t play mind-games or make them feel like shit in the process. And if you truly want to cover your bases? Call fellow writers out on their bullshit.\u00a0\nI mean, you don\u2019t have to start a flame war, or anything so extreme, but if you truly want to increase the number of comments and the amount of written feedback on your fics... well, that\u2019s gonna start with making fandom a place where reviewers aren\u2019t constantly on tenterhooks over the reception their reviews might receive.\u00a0\nAnyway, reblog and add your own commentary, if you'd like. Can't promise I'll bother responding, but I assure you that flames are welcome. :  )"}, {"blog_name": "methmommygf", "id": 148570969495, "date": "2016-08-07 03:01:32 GMT", "timestamp": 1470538892, "tags": ["discourse", "I just heard of this idea and it's almost funny", "radfem", "radfems", "terf", "terfs"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZHXpjo2ANXHMN", "note_count": 0, "body": "Terf ain't a slur you stupids"}, {"blog_name": "prayers-for-rain", "id": 161406054918, "date": "2017-06-03 23:50:42 GMT", "timestamp": 1496533842, "tags": ["centaurs", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zr1mSg2MKZF86", "note_count": 0, "body": "the thing that bothers me abt the baby centaurs post that shows lil babies on foal bodies is that humans come out of the womb underdeveloped already (other animals can walk and stuff, babies can\u2019t)\nso centaur babies would gestate longer and both halves would be developed enough to function well enough"}, {"blog_name": "critical-and-cringe", "id": 181019175292, "date": "2018-12-11 16:04:39 GMT", "timestamp": 1544544279, "tags": ["discourse", "GAD/general anxiety disorder", "i take meds and i still have anxiety problems but im a lot better", "im just venting you should probably ignore this"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZL5gYd2ebbMby", "note_count": 479, "body": "Ok like,,,\nI don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings but can we stop writing fics where Virgil like \ndies \nor stops working because of Thomas taking anxiety meds.\nI know that medication can sometimes have bad affects but as someone with GAD I feel like it perpetuates the idea ableists have that medicine for mental health \u201cchanges\u201d you (because Virgil is the personification of the FEELING of anxiety \nnot \nan anxiety disorder.)\nIf the fic is about a bad experience with medication where Thomas also feels the adverse affects, I can understand because sometimes meds don\u2019t work well for some people.

Men can never truly write teenage girl/women characters without sexism!! That doesn\u2019t mean a female character written by men cannot be seen as valuable, relatable, inherently good, and multifaceted by female viewers! \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "murderturtles", "id": 172523076148, "date": "2018-04-02 16:34:42 GMT", "timestamp": 1522686882, "tags": ["unpopular opinion", "gay", "straight", "discourse", "possibly", "i hope not"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZrwEmf2WhBJeq", "note_count": 4, "body": "Unpopular gay opinion:\nStraight people are valid\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "lovesyoudeerly", "id": 165582934988, "date": "2017-09-21 14:37:05 GMT", "timestamp": 1506004625, "tags": ["me", "dont answer this", "but also you know im right", "this movie is from 2005 but that meme refueled my anger", "discourse", "discuss", "tea", "where is the justice", "stop teaching men just cause they apologize they get to have whatever they want"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZVXBGw2QDWnFC", "note_count": 3, "body": "okay but raise your hand if you think Layla from Sky High\u00a0\u2122 should\u2019ve got with hot emo Warren Peace instead of bitch ass whats his face who ignored her once he got popular???"}, {"blog_name": "art-of-eons", "id": 180568533110, "date": "2018-11-28 00:40:22 GMT", "timestamp": 1543365622, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZoPbLq2eAkIXs", "note_count": 43, "body": "It seems sort of ironic how much of modern \u201cChristian politics\u201d is centered around reactionary rural idealism when, according to the Bible, the end of recorded history begins with the revelation of New Jerusalem, the Holy City.\nIts a rural setting (the garden) where the Bible begins and the fall of man takes place - but the second coming and the eternal kingdom (as described in Revelations at the end of the Bible) takes place in an urban setting."}, {"blog_name": "fagoroki", "id": 175389477434, "date": "2018-06-30 01:22:39 GMT", "timestamp": 1530321759, "tags": ["ok to rb", "discourse", "agere discourse", "age regression discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZlFz5e2ZM1mew", "note_count": 7, "body": "damn i wish cglre would realize nobody would give a shit abt them if they stopped crosstagging with tags used by kink (sfw little, etc)\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "hallowsvilbur", "id": 659256553406382080, "date": "2021-08-11 21:07:22 GMT", "timestamp": 1628716042, "tags": ["ram.txt", "discourse", "ableism cw"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZzvWKTac9bUfei00", "note_count": 21, "body": "literally obsessed with that one tweet where someone said that all of c!dream's wrongdoings were from an evil DID alter. like how do you write that and not think its fucking idiotic"}, {"blog_name": "bdoubleowo", "id": 657805680759209984, "date": "2021-07-26 20:46:22 GMT", "timestamp": 1627332382, "tags": ["og post", "discourse", "I guess technically", "just tagging to be safe"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZF_ZpTaW-iWCum00", "note_count": 26, "body": "How to get non pvp/parkour based games in mcc without Twitter throwing a hissyfit:\nGet big streamers like Dream/George/sapnap/tubbo/ranboo to talk on stream/tweet about wanting more building/creativity/technical games (whatever game they\u2019re gonna add) THEN announce the new game. \nAlso if it\u2019s a creative game don\u2019t make it judged by admins that\u2019s a recipe for harassment "}, {"blog_name": "vote-for-eggman", "id": 173586097966, "date": "2018-05-04 20:59:52 GMT", "timestamp": 1525467592, "tags": ["discourse", "y'all can try to fight me on this i said what i said"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7nOTg2XgYQSk", "note_count": 22, "body": "The\u00a0\u201ctruscum/transmed\u201d community is acting EXACTLY like the\u00a0\u201ctucute/transtrender\u201d community and that\u2019s the real \u2018tea\u2019"}, {"blog_name": "truscum-pearl", "id": 178180208680, "date": "2018-09-17 14:31:16 GMT", "timestamp": 1537194676, "tags": ["discourse", "disc horse", "transgender", "trans", "transmed", "truscum"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZHYn8Z2byNZWe", "note_count": 10, "body": "Hot Take\nHaving a genital preference is not transphobic  but if you dont care about genitals and only refuse to date someone because they are trans, that is."}, {"blog_name": "komahinacorner", "id": 177800988267, "date": "2018-09-06 13:33:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1536240795, "tags": ["Komahina", "This is like", "The only reason I see people can komahina toxic", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZlIOqY2bbmyPh", "note_count": 68, "body": "I love when people call a ship toxic because one of the people is mentally ill.

No one is going to take you seriously outside of Tumblr.\n\nSo here\u2019s my 2 cents as a gay man, having lived in Japan (albeit briefly) and as someone who is active in my local LGBT+ community (as a side note, English isn\u2019t my first language so please bare with me):\n\nA good majority of this discourse bullshit could be turned into a teaching opportunity seeing as many Fujoshi have an interest in the LBGt+ community. You find mlm content written by woman? Wonderful. Comment. Support her. Give her tips. Instead of telling her she\u2019s not allowed to write that fanfic or story and sending her death threats? Recommend some books of a similar genre written by LBGT+ authors. Show them to LBGT+ events. Educate. If they show interest in our community, show them how they can support us. Do it gently.\n\nBecause the majority of these \"gross\u201d fujoshi I see everyone complaining about are kids. Teenagers. In all likelihood, yaoi, BL, GL, and yuri are how they\u2019re introduced into our community. Or a refuge for them to safely express their sexualities when they\u2019re just starting to figure things out. I know it was/is for me.\n\nAnd, yeah. I\u2019m definitely not going to deny that there are unrealistic portrayals in yaoi/BL\u2013 because there are \n(and this isn\u2019t just limited to content made by women fyi- geicomi comes to mind foremost)\n.\u00a0 For sure.\u00a0 And yes. There are people who project these unrealistic portrayals onto real people, but it\u2019s so few and far between. Again? Educate. But as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m an active member in my community and Fujoshi have mostly been very respectful allies. \nI\u2019m going to emphasize on allies here. They\u2019re very important. These kids and teenagers are eventually going to grow out of the \u201cgross\u201d fujoshi stage. I\u2019ve seen it. In the anti tags. In the pro tags. With real flesh and blood people. What are you going to leave them with when they reach that point? \nWhen you see a group of people saying that they will actively wish harm and do harm, will you support them? Fuck no. And we truly need all of the support we can get. \nAlso, this notion of limiting the kind of content people outside of the community can interact with will definitely not help out LBGT+ people, either. Why? Because not only will you we get a lot less content, you\u2019re taking away resources that they can use to understand our cause- and potentially understand themselves. I\u2019m going to quote \n@\nnikolavanhanen \nhere because he worded far more eloquently than I ever could have:\n\u201cOn the topic of mlm material, I\u2019ve seen the opinion that it should only be written by gay men and consumed by gay men. \u00a0Why is this? \u00a0Reading from sources of a different perspective helps the readers gain a different perspective. \u00a0If you want the world at large to accept and respect the LGBT community, why cut them off from valuable resources. \u00a0How can anyone expect someone to accept what they don\u2019t understand? \u00a0There is no denying that books and stories from gay men are important keys to proper representation\u2014 so why would anyone want to cut that off from potential allies? \u00a0These materials are important in exploring and discovering one\u2019s sexuality as well as opening up different possibilities to those who do not share the same sexuality. \u00a0Many people I\u2019ve met used yaoi as a stepping stone into discovering their own sexualities (and yes, that does include a good number of gay men). \u00a0At the very least, yaoi opens a portal to the possibilities of gay as a concept. \u00a0 \nIgnoring the problem and just going about your business doesn\u2019t fix the problem? \u00a0Also true. \u00a0But going around and demonizing potential allies also does not solve the problem. \u00a0Out of personal experience and this acid trip of a journey through Tumblr, the fujoshi culture is, at the very least, open to LGBT ideologies. \u00a0The great majority of the ones that I\u2019ve interacted with have actually been very intelligent, respectful, and supportive. Of course, some have also stepped into the sketchy territory, but there are radicals on all sides. \u00a0Personally, I draw the line at the point when yaoi tropes are applied to real people. \u00a0Those types of situations are few and far between, however. \u00a0Instead of condemning the fujoshi community, take the opportunity to discuss ways in which the LGBT can be supported. \u00a0Offer up some reading material created by LGBT authors. \u00a0Point them in the direction of some charitable organizations and events. \u00a0Baseless hate and name calling does nothing more than make our own community look like a bunch of sour assholes.\u201d\nPlease, tell me. With all this negativity and energy you\u2019re pouring into this discourse, how much good does it actually bring back? How does all this suicide bating, name calling, and antagonizing make you any different from the homophobes that do it us?\nAnd let\u2019s be clear: if you told me that you were against objectifying real people, I\u2019d be with you there.\u00a0 But this whole anti-fujoshi movement is not what that\u2019s about.\u00a0 It\u2019s about control."}, {"blog_name": "clevercorvidae", "id": 645868044887932928, "date": "2021-03-17 02:22:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1615947766, "tags": ["mcyt", "sbi", "discourse", "like seriously if the only thing you can find on a dude", "is saying the r slur four years ago", "then I really think you need to take a step back", "I\u2019m saying this as a neurodivergent person btw"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZyQ7abZsbP2RKa00", "note_count": 15, "body": "Why are people randomly deciding to hold the sbi members accountable for stuff that happened years ago that they\u2019ve either publicly denounced or clearly moved on from?

What the split attraction model says is that having an orientation (e.g lesbian) is made of \ndifferent types of attraction\n e.g \nsexual\n \nand\n \nromantic\n, and that sometimes people don\u2019t have all those types of attraction (e.g asexual lesbian or aromantic lesbian), or those types of attraction are different (e.g bisexual homoromantic (sexually attracted to multiple genders, romantically attracted to your own)).\u00a0\nIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to label yourself like that, but you shouldn\u2019t go around spreading misinformation and saying the split attraction model is bad when it just isn\u2019t.\nAnd while I\u2019m at it,no, being demi is not the same as allo.

Demi people don\u2019t get those crushes. We never get celebrity crushes or stuff like that. Basically, we only ever get crushes on our best/close friends. No attraction whatsoever to anyone else.\nTo emphasise this point, I, a demiromantic lesbian, thought I was completely aro for a few years before i got a crush on my best friend, and realised that it had happened twice before with other people after I knew them for a few years.I never had romantic attraction to anyone else. Never. Not even a little bit. Only those three people after i knew them for a couple of years.\nBeing Demi isn\u2019t just straight people wanting to join the community or whatever, because why would there be demi gays and Demi lesbians(like me, a demiromantic asexual lesbian) and Demi pan ect people?\u00a0\n(Other demis,correct me if i\u2019m wrong!)"}, {"blog_name": "trench-rat", "id": 658629318989201408, "date": "2021-08-04 22:57:45 GMT", "timestamp": 1628117865, "tags": ["shut up vic", "discourse", "vent"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZKx0OXaZw_150a00", "note_count": 18, "body": "Harassment will radicalise me further.

I\u2019m intentionally avoiding it, and am absorbing secondhand.\nTW I am going to go into details about a history of sexual abuse involving children. It\u2019s my own story.\nI was raped consistently by a member of my family who was supposed to be a caretaker with me. This person also used manipulative and mind gamey tactics to control me, to destroy my self image, and to pit my sister and I against one another for their affections. I\u2019m not comfortable disclosing who, specifically, to such a public audience, but it\u2019s someone who would make anyone very sad to hear. Someone who\u2019s supposed to take care of you. Someone who\u2019s supposed to be a force of goodness and light in the life of a small child.\nThis isn\u2019t the entire reason I hate Stridercest so much, but I think it\u2019s most of why I\u2019m downright fucking *triggered* by it.\nSick-to-my-stomach, dizzy for hours, need to shut off my computer and deal with my shit triggered. It\u2019s not my only trigger. It\u2019s not even my biggest one. But I think it\u2019s the simplest and least debatable one. Bro = Dave\u2019s caretaker, someone supposed to love him, reminding me of my ______. Stridercest, therefore, Bro or Dirk style, is hard for me personally not to extrapolate into taking that twisted relationship and turning it into something lurid and sexy and interesting and darkly cool. I just can\u2019t with it. I blacklist, I avoid the topic, and so forth. Just making this post is making me queasy.\nBut here\u2019s the thing --\nI don\u2019t think Stridercest shippers, even ones who create the content for the ship I find most objectionable, are bad people. Or that they\u2019re supporting incest or CSA. Or even that they\u2019re privileged enough not to have my experiences.\nI, in fact, know for certain that some of them have been through similar things I have. They have seen some dark shit, and they use this as a way to work through it, or even, you know, they just like it because they see it differently than me, and though it\u2019s hard for me, I have to accept that that\u2019s okay, because they are not me, and they are not responsible for me. As long as they are not out there in the streets advocating for \u201cconsentual\u201d (hurts to type) incestual relations between caretakers and their charges, they are people writing fiction, drawing art, and, and here is the important thing, TAGGING THEIR WORK.\n\u201cBut predators use fanworks to groom actual minors!\u201d\nThis is extremely, painfully true. Believe it or not, I\u2019ve got some experience here, as well involving a man 10 years my senior when I was in high school and an old MUD, and come on, please don\u2019t make me disclose every single thing I\u2019ve ever gone through here. But tagging is the difference. The groomers are not the kind who say\u00a0\u201cmind the tags\u201d and make sure that their work is carefully labeled. People who don\u2019t understand that incest is Very Bad are the ones\u00a0\u201cforgetting\u201d to tag incest and using that as a way to reach out to minors. My MUD-friend was all about the\u00a0\u201cwell you see, we\u2019re roleplaying people of the same age.\u201d He would never have tagged his work.\nUntagged Stridercest makes me RAGE. But when it\u2019s tagged, it\u2019s squirreled away, and I have to trust that the people with the responsibility to tag their work know how to engage with it responsibly, because I cannot and should not police every single person in a fandom to make sure their views align with mine.\nI am also triggered (hard) by Vriska and most Vriska ships, certain hcs, and some pretty common stuff. But that\u2019s not your problem. It\u2019s mine. And as long as you keep it all nicely tagged, what else can I ask for? What else SHOULD I ask for? Nothing.\nI hate disclosing this shit, not because I want to keep it private, but because I just hate it. I hate playing into this trump card\u00a0\u201cI get to discuss this because\u201d culture, but maybe it\u2019ll reach some people on the fence. Maybe some people will see this from my perspective.\nI don\u2019t know.\nStay safe out there, and if you take one thing from all of this, actually... just talk to people. Send a message. Send a friend with a message if you\u2019re blocked. Engage, one on one, if you think someone is doing something they really shouldn\u2019t be. Be willing to speak, AND be willing to hear. Don\u2019t circlejerk with your friends until you\u2019re overboiling. Don\u2019t assume other people\u2019s situations.

Both the trolls and member berries further represent\nthe dangers of far-right thought and why it\u2019s allowed to thrive; it comes from\na combination of anonymity and nostalgia distancing people from \u2018others\u2019 and\nbecoming reactionary by not being willing to take an interest in new things,\nonly demanding a continuous stream of retrogression.\nAdditionally, with the\nPresidential election, Giant Douche reflects the way that Trump is thoroughly\nunfamiliar with and unfit to partake in real politics in spite of his\npopularity, whilst Turd Sandwich shows how Clinton struggles to connect with\nvoters in spite of the threat of her opponent.\nCartman and Heidi\nrepresent non-voters who have no faith in the system to fix things. They suffered\nas a result of trolling, and it took away their faith in the system to make\nthings better. Instead, they try and work around it, having a happy existence\nof their own, but at the cost of helping everyone else.\nFinally, we come to\nWendy, Stan and Kyle. In earlier seasons, they had been the moderate,\nmainstream political ones, the ones who got to carry the ethics of the show. With\nthe centre ground shrinking away, they\u2019re forced into supporting extreme\nactions that hurt those around them; Wendy puts the girls\u2019 efforts to stop the\ntrolling ahead of Stan\u2019s feelings; Stan in turn puts acceptance from the boys\nahead of Wendy\u2019s feelings; and Kyle, seeking the help of Cartman and Heidi as\nthose above the pettiness, discovers how petty they really are, and resigns to\npartaking in something he knows in his consciousness is wrong out of despair.\nOverall, the arc\nimplicates political extremism for the prejudices and division it causes in\nfavour of moderation, which in spite of being associated with mainstream ideas\nand considerable problems with society has led to gradual positive changes. The\nfact that things have apparently returned to normal for Fractured But Whole\nindicates this will be resolved and the character derailments are both\nintentional and temporary, although given that Trump and his supporters seem to\nbe implicated in the arc particularly significantly, there remains the\npossibility the arc may cause permanent changes to the character dynamics if he\nwere to win."}, {"blog_name": "pryde-the-manticorn", "id": 175268042566, "date": "2018-06-26 10:01:57 GMT", "timestamp": 1530007317, "tags": ["discourse", "Tumblr tags don't allow quotation marks", "Op", "long post"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZrVLOe2ZEoXT6", "note_count": 1, "body": "Everywhere online all I'm seeing is people aggressively saying be careful what you enjoy.

Which is absolutely ridiculous. If you take a closer look at Islam, you would see that it has a lot of similarities with Christianity, the same people, the same basic history of Israel and the Middle East, with the difference of Ishmael being the son to receive Abraham's inheritance instead of Issac, no Trinity, and with Jesus being a prophet instead of God. Where exactly is this satanic? Hell it has more similarities than many sects of Christianity, e.g. Mormonism. Mormonism believes that the Trinity is three separate beings, God literally fathered the spirits of the entire human race, and probably the most outrageously different, that people can become joint heirs with Christ and essentially become God. Ok first and foremost, any man declaring himself as God in the Christian religion and in Islam is considered blasphemy. So why have I never seen a white Christian Mormonphobic (ignoring the beginnings of their religion and how Christians felt about it then)? Because Mormons are white and their religion is viewed as a Christian sect and not as a different (foreign) religion entirely, and thusly not satanic. Mormonism is a white religion. And thusly it isn't foreign, unlike Islam. Islamophobia is fueled by racism. It's not white so it's foreign so it's immediately Satanic.

His struggles of basically being bullied and being passed around a lot would leave a regular human bitter towards life, but that's not the case. \n\nThose nations with rough histories and are being portayed as ones who choose to ignore the past and make every day better than the last are the real heroes. They choose not to dwell on their pasts and make life the best. \n\nI understand that every nation has their bad parts of history, but what they choose to think about it really helps to develop their characters. There could alos be censorship laws or certain customs they have to abide by, and that's okay. \n\nThis is just my interpretation of how some nations appear to me. Please do not attack me on this. I would love some discussion about characterizations for my babies."}, {"blog_name": "finnwrld", "id": 655228536697847808, "date": "2021-06-28 10:03:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1624874626, "tags": ["im gonna tag this as", "discourse", "just bc it could be seen as that yk", "idk man like i am really worried ab over stepping boundaries", "and it doesnt seem like a lot of cc's know what self insert shit is", "like idk how i feel ab it", "like i prob wont write anymore x reader content", "but im debating on just like deleting them", "but i also worked really hard on a lot of them", "idk man"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZXChpUaNrk7mam00", "note_count": 7, "body": "im really like heavily rethinking having these mcyt x reader fics on my  blog like idk guys.....

But if that music can strike such a chord with him, then there must be some honesty in there."}, {"blog_name": "appleflavoredkitkats", "id": 649220890716946432, "date": "2021-04-23 02:34:49 GMT", "timestamp": 1619145289, "tags": ["quackity", "mcyt", "discourse", "quackity critical", "critical", "long post"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zdp4nea2VlNRya00", "note_count": 306, "body": "\n\ni haven\u2019t watched the stream because i have big second hand embarrassment but even if the writers of those weird fanfictions have broken boundaries, can we say that... these writers might\u2019ve been young minors...?\ni\u2019ve written stuff on wattpad as a 10-12 year old, and my fanfics were- whew they were not good. when i was younger, i never understood the concept of \u201cboundaries\u201d or understood what a terrible joke was because when i was that age, we basically just?? don\u2019t listen to anyone or anything?? sure, these fics can be awful, but they were never done out of malice or ill intent because I WAS A CHILD.\ni know those who wrote those fanfictions have broken boundaries, but again, these people are minors who just don\u2019t know better. we cannot villainize children for being children, and even if they did something wrong, it\u2019s MUCH better to message them about what they did wrong instead of bashing them on twitter or tumblr. if they don\u2019t listen, i promise you that in a few years, the people will probably regret it, because as children, WE JUST DON\u2019T KNOW BETTER.\n\u201cthey should\u2019ve known cc\u2019s are going to see it!\u201d firstly, when do cc\u2019s every make their way to appreciate fanfictions in the first place? secondly, i mean, i could always use the argument of\u00a0\u201cthey didn\u2019t know better\u201d because it\u2019s true- they just didn\u2019t know.\n\n\n\"if the author didnt want criticism they shouldnt have posted it\" ok but you literally wouldn\u2019t say that to a beginner visual artist, so why apply that to any other artist as well? i need to emphasize that these people are probably just... children having fun? children in their free time?\ntldr; stop villainizing children for not knowing better. acting like children are capable of being malicious is like blaming children for being children. don\u2019t send them any hate, don\u2019t send quackity any hate, don\u2019t make fun of the writing, just move on from the stream and chill out"}, {"blog_name": "lavandin-bi", "id": 175764360456, "date": "2018-07-11 02:13:42 GMT", "timestamp": 1531275222, "tags": ["bi", "bisexual", "lesbian", "discourse", "butch", "femme", "doe", "tomcat"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Ze8FQZ2ZiNqq8", "note_count": 6, "body": "Yuh it\u2019s fine to say butch/femme is lesbian exclusive but don\u2019t get fucking condescending and say \u201cur not femme because you like skirts sweetie :/\u201c as if...only lesbians can experience the feeling of wanting a label on their roles and attractions?

I think this is in fact a specific case of a much more general phenomenon, one that has what seem to me like a number of important implications.\nIt is not only moral systems that can be incompatible, it is basically any belief. We will amend that for our purposes to \u201cany belief that is not part of the subject of discussion\u201d, the subject of discussion being a set of claims that the participants are attempting to confront, since beliefs that are part of the subject can be resolved. At times, not all the participants in an argument will agree on what the subject is. If that happens, they are likely to yell at each other uselessly. The way the subject is negotiated, communicated, and changed over the course of an argument is rather interesting but perhaps the topic for a different post. For now we will satisfy ourselves with being able to generalize the example into the observation that a difference of opinion that is part of the subject of discussion is often grounded in a difference of belief that isn\u2019t, which we will call an irreconcilable belief.\nIn a friendly good faith argument, the subject of discussion can be widened to include the belief, and progress further (in effect, the subject of discussion is included in the subject of discussion). If that is not done, though, the argument is severely impaired, or even made impossible. I believe there are two general strategies regarding irreconcilable beliefs. The first is to avoid exposing them, while the second is to deliberately hunt them. Everyone uses both in some measure, to a degree depending among other things on the subject of the argument, and I do not believe one is superior to the other, they each have advantages and disadvantages. If the arguers do not agree on which strategy should be employed, they are liable to have an unpleasant time. Additionally, since these strategies are, as far as I can tell, employed automatically and not consciously, it is somewhat difficult to negotiate which strategy should be employed.\nThe avoidant strategy, where you try to not expose irreconcilable beliefs within a discussion, can be said to be effective. It keeps the argument going for long, avoids the need to renegotiate the subject frequently, and allows the arguers to demonstrate their reasoning and rhetorical capabilities and that they are well-informed about the topic. The core of the strategy is avoiding discussing that on which it is possible the arguers disagree, and which they are unlikely to reconsider, instead focusing for example on well-defined factual questions. If the controversy is unavoidable, Devil\u2019s Advocate or a similar device may be used to avoid pinning anyone down too much. The weakness of the strategy is that while the resulting argument is liable to be shallow. The heart of the disagreement is already obscured by design, but many potentially useful observations will also be discarded.\nBy contrast, the hunting strategy, where you actively expose irreconcilable beliefs, is efficient. It is likely to end the argument early, or transform it into one more likely to be productive, which saves a lot of time. The strategy works by having a good understanding of the other participants, understanding their beliefs and reasoning as well as your own, and articulating the irreconcilable belief clearly. The weakness of the strategy is that it stifles argument far more often than it enhances it, and that articulating an irreconcilable belief is, more or less by definition, a violation (or at least a very aggressive renegotiation) of the subject of discussion, which might be considered rude. \nSo what happens if we do have an argument where the participants have selected opposing strategies? An avoider will likely regard hunters as dogmatic and fundamentalist, and think the hunter is asking rude and irrelevant questions and trying to dodge the argument. A hunter will likely regard avoiders as unprincipled and opportunistic, and think the avoider is using details and rhetoric as a distraction and trying to dodge the argument. Neither is necessarily wrong, of course, but they may be uncharitable.

No one had ever said I was smart a school, I failed everything because I couldn\u2019t read or write, but the OT who diagnosed me framed it as nothing is wrong with you it\u2019s just the way they\u2019ve been trying to teach you is wrong for you.\nIn contrast, when teachers talked to me about ADD it was framed in the negative. There\u2019s something wrong with her and it needs to be corrected with medication. My mother was firmly against people saying there\u2019s something wrong with your child and worked to get my diagnostic testing which revealed the learning disabilities which were a big cause of some the issues I had with school. \nI actually \ndo\n have ADD and I do need medication. \nMy life is overall better on it since I\u2019ve started taking it but I only started at age 27, because the way they framed the discussion, there is something wrong with you and we will change you, made me reject the notion all together.\u00a0\nI struggled socially as well as academically and when they talked about aspergers it was framed as\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ve figured out what\u2019s wrong with her, she has aspergers\u2019 once again framing difference as defect, the reason you\u2019re weird. That didn\u2019t help me. I didn\u2019t want a label to confirm that I was a freak, I was all ready treated that way at school and I didn\u2019t want there to be anything wrong with me. It made it seem like bullies were right, that there was something about me that made me different from them and lesser than them because the differences were something wrong.\nThis did not make me want to accept the label or seek help for it. It didn\u2019t help my self esteem. It made me work harder not to be weird and hate myself when I failed.\u00a0\nIn contrast, as an adult, when\n I discovered the dyspraxia diagnosis on my own \nand read about it on a website for dyspraxics (not parents of children trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with their kid) I was happy to find something that explained almost every issue I\u2019d struggled with my who life and framed it as something that requires resources to help instead of something that makes you a problem/not as good.\u00a0\nI may be on the autistic spectrum as well, there seems to be a lot of overlap with dyspraxia with Emotional and Behavioral symptoms overlapping a lot, so I\u2019m not sure. As an adult with autistic best friends and access to info about autism by autistic people I don\u2019t reject that off hand. My point here isn\u2019t about diagnosing people but about how we treat putting labels on people, but about how we do it.\nInsisting that we should treat developmental disability as a\u00a0\u2018problem\u2019, discussing it the way we would an illness, framing the discussion on how a child with X is a problem, does not help get children the resources they need. All it does is make children less likely to accept a label that has stigma and shifts focus away from how to give a child what they need to thrive to preventing people like them, which only reenforces the notion that you are a problem, not you are different and can do great things with the proper tools.\u00a0\nEven in the best case scenario where a child does get resources and does well the attitude still hurts them. Because if you\u2019re gifted and disabled, our society frames it as\u00a0\u2018you don\u2019t have a disability\u2019 because they limit learning disability to performing at a level below everyone instead of something that keeps you from doing things you\u2019d be able to do otherwise, meaning resources can be cut off as soon as you reach a higher level in school. You can\u2019t be\u00a0\u2018that\u2019 because you function well enough to pass isn\u2019t helpful because the minute you don\u2019t function normally then it\u2019s seen as willful failure.\u00a0\nWe cannot treat development differences as illness or frame our discussion and understanding of them in terms of\u00a0\u2018a problem\u2019. It\u2019s not a problem to be fixed it\u2019s a difference in how a person functions that needs to be accepted and addressed with resources that are framed as\u00a0\u2018giving\u2019 not\u00a0\u2018fixing\u2019.

(and I'm not just talking about whether the characters view it as bad, how is the WRITER approaching it) my issue lies with how we're normalising things. because the way people think is effected by this. if every depiction of abuse treats it as romance (which kind of already happens to a degree) then people over time will start to see those actions that way. hell ao3 has done a great job of normalising the underage tag, nobody bats an eye anymore at needing to exclude a warning that in essence means 'smut written about children & teens'. \nso I'm REALLY fucking tired of these posts trying to be all 'oOOooO yOu cAnT wRiTe aNyThiNg aNyMoRe' because I can't argue against them, because they're not arguing against \nme\n. they're just doing the internet classic of making up a guy to be mad about.

Even if it\u2019s another person your age trying to convince you, they could be lying about their age first of all, but if not, then they\u2019re just another victim.\nMy little brother makes distasteful jokes a lot, and whenever he jokes about incest being good in a way that isn\u2019t clearly a joke or refuses to say \u201cjust kidding\u201d I get VERY uncomfortable. Now I don\u2019t think he would participate in any incest, seeing as he isn\u2019t very close in age with any of us and doesn\u2019t get along with the ones around his age the best, PLUS he\u2019s literally the type of kid to be a troll on the internet (really annoying btw) so I don\u2019t think he actually believes the stuff he says. But the possibility of him thinking it would be okay disgusts me. I mean he\u2019s really young, and seeing how much he makes incest and pedo and rape jokes, it\u2019s possible there are people on the internet convincing him that it\u2019s actually okay. I really want to take the internet away from him sometimes, he watched nazi memes once and that was a whole thing we as a family had to shun out of him. Unfortunately I do not have any control over his internet especially with the whole divorced household thing.\nDidn\u2019t mean to go on a rant about my little brother that I worry about a lot but basically, I get really uncomfortable when my brother makes incest jokes in a not joking tone, and I don\u2019t see why kids shouldn\u2019t feel the same about adults making pedophilia seem cool.\nI forgot what I was talking about uh proship bad I rant about it too much bye"}, {"blog_name": "bi-the-way-im-a-mess", "id": 177510686330, "date": "2018-08-29 08:02:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1535529721, "tags": ["biseuxal", "panseuxal", "bi pan solidarity", "discourse", "pi", "lgbt community", "queer"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z6yhLZ2bKTXvw", "note_count": 6, "body": "Pan vs. Bi\nGuys, I have a theory, there\u2019s so much discourse between bi vs pan, but most people agree that you should identify however you feel comfortable right?

Disclaimer that aside from these certain criticisms I enjoyed each individual's series very much/I didn't mind other things (this is also a faux ranking) If you don't want anything remotely negative about this series kindly scroll away. \n1. Shubble had hands down the best story. Cohesive enough to make me feel like her ending was very cathartic (and I unapologetically claim she had the best finale). She interacted the most with Xornoth and their relationship of animosity felt the most compelling. She was more of a foil to Xornoth than Scott was. Shelby very much felt like she had her own story rather than just being strung along to whatever lore was there. \n2. Joel and Katherine were probably the characters that felt the most \"complete\" in a sense. They built up their Empires, set up their own lore (I am of the opinion that the Mother Tree and the Spring of the Overgrown are lore still). Though Katherine participated in the Xornoth stuff, she didn't participate in it enough that I expected her to be more lore heavy in her story, so her ending being her kingdom being destroyed is fine I suppose. Joel, meanwhile, is Joel. My only gripe with him is he bit off more than he can chew with his megabase.\n3. Pearl is like Joel and Katherine, her story felt more complete than others, but I wanted more from her kingdom which is just a nitpick (expected more buildings, Farmer Villagers and the beanstalk to actually be a giantass sunflower) but I understand Pearl faced a lot of complications in moving and hardware so it's understandable.\n4. Lizzie was probably the POV I looked forward to the most because Lizzie is just so dang entertaining. My only gripes with her is she never really did anything with her lore except establish it. She (and Jimmy) could have found their codxolotl parent and find out the relationship between it and some cod deity so the conflict of the finale made more sense. \"oh you can't utilize salmon and cod together that's bad\" why though.\n5. Joey was mostly chaotic, built his empire, fell in love with a demon, did toxic shit for them, built his empire and spent the afterlife with his demon lover, well, at least it's within character.\n6. Pixlriffs had a lot of loose ends (prophetic implications, Phantom Assassin, Sausage Diss Track) but I like his characterization and  he just felt less messy.\n7. My gripe with Jimmy, other than the criticism in Lizzie's section, is I never understood why the Codfather head was so important. It's very McGuffin-y in that sense.  If it's because of Jimmy's a bit unhinged (cause damaged egg) it's a bit unsatisfying then. Something more compelling is what I want yall.\n8. Gem and Scott were very lore-heavy, but their stories felt very... Off. I feel like I should have felt more with their stories, but I never did, sorry. Gem never grew from the disconnected, unaligning, \"does good not for good's sake but rather had to be done\", selfish (shit move on the Roseblings not even considering Sausage before leaving after showing that the three had a close relationship yall, even if Sausage wanted a different end for his character) character and Scott just didn't... make his relationship with Xornoth compelling enough that Xornoth's banishment just felt hollow on Scott's part and the ending didn't feel happy as I feel like it was framed. \n(I also really hated Gem's \"roleplay\" tag that was there for the whole vid, it could've just been at the beginning of the vid rather than just there. Really ruins the immersion. Sorry if anyone needs it or something) \n9. I don't watch fwhip's and sausage's povs so not much comment on them.

This is both on the part of the movie writing  itself, which as I've already described at length in my own grumpy \ncritique\n  couches its extremely juvenile approach to themes in aesthetics of depth without actually building upon them. The Riddler himself is basically just an amalgam of \"oooh scary looking visual shorthand\" aka serial killer mystery vibes, toxic internet conspirator, with a big wide brush of Hollywood typical \"uhhhh the villain will make some general Good Points about Society Corruption  but also we need to make him crAZY and kill people to show that he is Too Radical Actually\" which is less Deep and more a tired character and plot convenience. This is just my guess but the lukewarmness of it feels like it's meant to be projected upon so that the vaguely left people can be like \"damn.....his nerdy look means he must be a creepy incel and his streamer voice reminds me of like those crazy right wing conspiracy people\" and the right wing watchers can be like \"so true...he's a great villain bc he reminds me of one of those dangerous radical leftists who go on twitch and make video essays about why rich people are bad\" when in reality the character is just an edgified version of a comic book goofyman made by a studio trying to sell the most tickets to the majority of the population across the board who want to see Nostalgic Bat Dude From Childhood be Edgy. Which like, that's fine, it's enjoyable, but can we please stop pretending the internal Politics of The fucking Batman are actually Super Cool and deep commentary. There definitely is always interesting stuff to comment on in a meta sense but I hope people can actually learn to recognize REAL white supremacist ideology since like. It permeates our lives and language and whatever and is reflected in power systems and economic access and beauty/health/acceptability standards and the history of basically anything here whatever and of course in an obvious surface way....saying and doing ....racist things...that isn't just manifested in vague grand Schrodinger's movie villain aesthetics.  Which doesn't mean everyone has to LIKE it, it's designed to be repulsive for a reason, and everyone can be annoyed by anything if they want lol. And of course anyone can cling to anything and act super bad and racist about it if they want to. But seeing that particular line of argument really fucking rubs me the wrong way because it both feels trivializing, and also just a piss poor read of the already thematically lukewarm and muddled text lol. \nAnyways. I liked the look of the movie, thought a lot of things sucked about it thematically (see link above), but the toxic emo/nerdcel yandere/goth gf fanart to come out of it has been absolutely a lot of fun and like, this always happens.

More often than not I feel like there is a fair amount of condescension toward students (not entirely undeserved, but nonetheless hypocritical) when they attempt to write like they are expected to write like even without the same amount of knowledge. I think it is easy to forget what it was like to read something the first time around when you've been in the field for years. I can't help but feel like there just as many professors who want to research and get paid for \"being an expert\" as there are who passionately love their subject and want to engage in a discussion of it with new minds. I hope that balance is tipping more toward the latter.\n\n\nThis \"fake it til you make it\" thing we talked about in class is a popular method of doing pretty much anything in American society, but we always leave out the fact that not everyone comes equipped with the stuff that allows you to fake it in the first place and even more do not, in actuality, make it. When we couple this failing to fake it properly with the fact that we have a really loose working definition of what plagiarism is (loose in perception because it is never really talked about in depth and loose in definition because, honestly, it is a loose concept), it isn't surprising that we produce a lot of the problems that academia spends a lot of time trying to fix. I was glad to hear that this was a pretty basic piece that anyone studying writing at the post-grad level is most likely going to have to read because there was an air of compassion to it. I wish this was something people had to read (or, more specifically, retain) before becoming professors.\n\n\nThis piece, however, did get me thinking a lot about the purpose of jargon. It is a pain in the ass to learn and, to a certain extent, I feel like there seems to be an inordinate amount of time spent in laying out what these terms mean, redefining them, and then arguing some more about meaning. That being said, once there is a nuanced understanding of the terms themselves they can become a sort of shorthand for calling up multiple theories in one word. And, after reading an article for another class, I have to admit that a large part of academia and its uses lies in redefining arguments, and this done primarily, though not indiscriminately, in jargon. The circular notion of the article supposed, in my reductionist wording, that the purpose of communication is to further communication. With that, I can't argue... and even if I did, it would serve the purpose, so there you go.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "tittybitch", "id": 651643334798016512, "date": "2021-05-19 20:18:31 GMT", "timestamp": 1621455511, "tags": ["discourse", "ranboolive", "ranboo"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z1qEYoaB6YaIum00", "note_count": 50, "body": "Ok, so people are mad about Ranboo making dressing up like a lesbian jokes and as someone who was always bothered by these jokes, I accept his apology (I\u2019m a lesbian) because he has shown so much growth and has built such a supportive community.

It\u2019s an attraction to femininity, or people on the feminine end of the gender spectrum, while not exclusively being attracted to people who identify as girls.\nAnd I understand not wanting to create a new term or microlabels. I\u2019ve been struggling with my identity and trying different microlabels for YEARS, having to explain them got so exhausting I generalized myself to asexual and GNC. Creating new labels or using microlabels and having to explain to people over and over is a pain in the ass.\nIt\u2019s always relieving to find a label you think fits.\nBut even so...\nI can see why people are so upset over this mishmash of terms.\nTo begin with it took me ages to find a proper explanation to\u00a0\u201cWhy do people call themselves bi/pan lesbians?\u201d If the whole reason you\u2019re using bi/pan lesbian is so you don\u2019t need to explain a new label or a microlabel, it completely backfired. The general public has no idea what it means, and so to outsiders, it looks like a transphobic or biphobic or panphobic term.\nSo why not say you\u2019re bi/pan with a female preference or \u2018lean\u2019? People will understand that, and won\u2019t bat an eye. I\u2019ve met plenty of people who say they\u2019re bi with a preference for women, and then have a few exceptions for certain guys. Bi literally means\u00a0\u201csexually attracted not exclusively to people of one particular gender; attracted to both men and women.\u201d I got that when I looked it up, copy pasted it here from yahoo search.\u00a0Pan is pretty much the same, just with different connotations. If you say you\u2019re attracted to women and \nsome\n men, then you still fit under that definition. And NB people are inherently included in the bi/pan labels, as bisexuals have been trying to explain to biphobes for years.\nSecondly, saying you\u2019re \u2018attracted to femininity,\u2019 and then telling an androgynous person you\u2019re attracted to them? That can be really offensive and harmful to them. My trans masc roommate and I spoke about this, and here\u2019s what he had to say about it:\n\u201cIf someone I knew identified as a bi lesbian and asked me out, I would be offended by that. It\u2019d be like they\u2019re saying\u00a0\u2018oh I\u2019ll date you even though you\u2019re a guy because you\u2019re feminine enough\u2019. That would trigger my dysphoria really badly because I\u2019m not on T, I know I\u2019m feminine. It feels like to me, if someone identified as a lesbian, but just tacks \u2018bi\u2019 or \u2018pan\u2019 onto it for the justification of dating me, it feels like it discounts my identity as a trans man. I feel like it would be saying \u2018okay, I\u2019ll call you a boy if you want, but you\u2019re still a girl to me\u2019.\u201d\nIf the intent of bi/pan lesbians is to be more inclusive and open, it completely backfired. I understand why so many people find comfort in this label. But it as a term it just isn\u2019t working.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being bi or pan and only rarely being attracted to men. You can do that.\nI hope that this act of adding\u00a0\u201cqualifiers\u201d to a non-umbrella term doesn\u2019t catch on for good.\n(T. E. R.

I\u2019m not a very active member (because the fandom can be a very hostile place) but I\u2019m an observer with a lot to say.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, I should say I\u2019m a multishipper. Yes, I enjoy Hollstein and Hollence pretty equally. I also like Danny and Carmilla pretty equally! Laura is my favorite character, I won\u2019t claim otherwise, but I am trying to work without bias.\n\n\nWhat I want to point out is how quick the *majority* (we\u2019ll get to the minority\u2019s problematic behavior later, and of course there are many people on both groups who do not do these things) of the fandom is to defend Carmilla and demonize anyone else.\n\n\nOf course, Carm is not always wrong! The opposite. But she\u2019s also not always RIGHT, and ***some*** (most certainly not all, but these ones are the most vocal) people defend her fiercely no matter what.\n\n\nCarmilla, Danny, and Laura all are flawed people. Laura, seeing no grey area. Just good or evil. Danny, being possessive of Laura, and acting petty when she was rejected, with a bias against vampires. Carmilla, being self-centered and occasionally cruel (more than occasionally in season 1, but that was just her being a grumpyface). All of them also show acts that go against their flaws. Laura in the season 2 finale, Carmilla and Danny in the season 1. But they do have their flaws. All of them.\n\n\nIn addition, neither Hollstein nor Hollence is \u201cabusive\u201d. Both sides have claimed the other is (it happens more frequently from Hollstein but that\u2019s most likely because of the much larger base. I\u2019m sure the ratio is semi-equal). But this isn\u2019t the case for either! However, they both have flaws. Why? Because the characters aren\u2019t perfect. Neither are their relationships!\n\n\nHollence definitely had some posessiveness and petty behavior on Danny\u2019s end. I won\u2019t deny that! It\u2019s true! The apples thing, the way she was so determined to protect Laura against her wishes. Those weren\u2019t great things! But also they were good friends after that point. Danny grew out of that, and she teamed up with Carmilla to fight the dean in the season 1 climax. She was the one who carried Carmilla in to Laura in the finale. She still had a prejudice against vampires, but that\u2019s irrelevant to Hollence. There is nothing abusive in this relationship.\n\n\nHollstein has ALSO been called abusive. Likely from both ends. Carmilla and Laura didn\u2019t exactly get along in season 1, at least the beginning, and then they began to flirt, at which point it became more like banter when they argued than like actual venom. And in season 2, Laura\u2019s prejudice against Vampires (to be fair to Laura, a big bit of it was her being upset that Carmilla had killed people which is valid. But a lot of it also came from an ignorant place) was a major pitstop in their relationship. But Laura finally overcame it when she asked for Carmilla\u2019s help.\n\n\nNow the Carmilla vs. Danny bit. Both of them are flawed (although Laura and Danny are the only ones I commonly see criticized) and both of them can make bad decisions\u2026 but when it comes down to it, THEY BOTH LOVE AND CARE ABOUT LAURA! And Danny\u2019s flaws are possessiveness, pettiness, and distrust towards vampires. All for sure are there. Carmilla\u2019s are occasional cruelty, former murder, and self-centeredness. People gloss over the murder bit a lot, but\u2026. She did very much kill people. Does that make it right for Danny to assume things about all vampires? No. Does it make it sort of logical? Yeah. I understand it, even if I know it\u2019s wrong. I also understand why Carmilla doesn\u2019t like Danny. They\u2019re both flawed. So is Laura. Stop pretending like one is evil to pretend the other is an angel.\n\n\nFinally, I end by saying that I\u2019ll probably get a lot of hate for this. But it needed to be said by someone as unbiased as possible. Let\u2019s get ready for Season 3, cream puffs!\n\n\nEDIT: I wanted to add that it's totally okay to dislike or hate a character or ship as long as you don't tear them down.

Standing by people who need help, and getting them that help. Going to protests. Educating yourself. Educating other people.

Quiz\u00e1s s\u00f3lo sea yo, pero se me hace incluso aburrido saber que no va a aparecer en el cap\u00edtulo. (Aunque Quico por s\u00ed solo no es bueno, tal y como se ve en su porquer\u00eda de serie \"Ah que Kiko!\")\nQue sustituyeran las escenas de Quico o la Chilindrina con \u00d1o\u00f1o o Malicha (en un par de cap\u00edtulos) respectivamente fu\u00e9 pat\u00e9tico. No solo repet\u00edan bromas por alguna raz\u00f3n, sino que encima las hac\u00edan peores y menos graciosas. (Malicha como personaje me gust\u00f3. Me hubiera gustado verla interactuar con la Chilindrina. Seguro que hubieran hecho bromas muy buenas).\nHablando de pat\u00e9tico, la serie se tendr\u00eda que haber terminado mucho antes de lo que lo hizo. Ver a un anciano que casi no pod\u00eda ni respirar interpretar a un ni\u00f1o que en su d\u00eda fu\u00e9 muy energ\u00e9tico es muy triste, por no hablar de que da verg\u00fcenza ajena.\nHe de admitir que no he visto muchos de los cap\u00edtulos que salieron por el final de la serie (lo intent\u00e9, pero me aburrieron), pero Jaimito el Cartero es una excusa de sustituci\u00f3n de Ron Dam\u00f3n. El personaje no pega con lo que hace. Es un anciano amable con un trabajo (cartero), \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 hacen que no quiera pagar la renta si tiene trabajo? Fu\u00e9 un personaje con potencial pero lo utilizaron de manera p\u00e9sima.\nSobre el Chavo Animado:\nLa serie animada es una mierda como una casa y que LO \u00daNICO que lo salva \u00e9s la nostalgia y ni eso.\nLa animaci\u00f3n es p\u00e9sima, en serio, \u00bfA qu\u00e9 estudio barato contrataron para hacer \u00e9sta porquer\u00eda? Vale que la serie original tuviera un presupuesto bajo (o eso creo), pero con buenos actores se pueden hacer cosas muy buenas con poco dinero.\nLas bromas/chistes no son lo mismo en dibujo que en persona. Escenas que me hicieron re\u00edr en la original me dan verg\u00fcenza ajena en la versi\u00f3n animada.\nQue la Chilindrina no salga en la serie animada es un insulto y una bofetada en la cara a Maria Antonienta de las Nieves, ya que ella estuvo en la serie original hasta el final y daba una din\u00e1mica muy buena, sobretodo entre ella, el Chavo y Quico.\nHablando del Chavo. \u00bfSoy el \u00fanico al que le da un poco de rabia que en el Chavo Animado siempre salga sonriendo? No digo que el Chavo no pueda sonre\u00edr ni nada de eso, pero si veis la serie original siempre tiene cara neutral o incluso trist\u00f3n, sonriendo solo cuando se ilusiona por algo.

I do not care if you are uncomfortable. Here is my exact reasoning. I say this as a nearly 30 year-old with 18 years of fandom experience, and many many squicks and dislikes.\u00a0\nDo you know what makes me uncomfortable? Infidelity. In fiction, in real life. To me, doing that to another person that trusts you is LITERALLY on par with rape and murder. I\u2019m fucking serious. Am I \u00a0attacking people for writing about it? No, of course not. Because it is MY responsibility as a consumer to pick and choose my content. It is my responsibility to avoid writers, artists, people who mention things I don\u2019t like.\nDo you know what made me uncomfortable as a teenager? Power imbalance. Teacher/student, boss/employee, you name it. Especially Snape/Any Student At Hogwarts. There are millions of fics about that. MILLIONS. I\u2019m not exaggerating. But I fucking survived. I didn\u2019t haunt those corners of FF.net and yahoo groups, I didn\u2019t look it up on DA, and when I stumbled upon some here and there, I scrolled past. I cannot expect other people to censor themselves to make me \ncomfortable\n. I never have and I never will.\u00a0\nIf it was about politely asking people to tag their shipping better, so that I can avoid it better, sure, but you anti-\u201dshaladins\u201d have never been about that. You\u2019ve been about censorship. You\u2019ve been about the world conforming to your personal tastes, and that\u2019s the most childish thing I\u2019ve seen in a \nlong\n\u00a0while, and I have a toddler.\nThis is the internet. Your right to be comfortable does not trump my right to write or draw whatever I want.\nWhether it\u2019s legal or not, moral or not, everyone has the right to imagine what they want, and that right is FAR more important than anyone\u2019s right to be \ncomfortable.\u00a0\nPS: There are no canon ages. Shiro and Pidge are only described as two of\u00a0\u201cfive teens\u201d. Your only real source has been written off by the actual showrunners. The only people making these ships pedophilic are the ones who insist that there\u2019s a serious age gap, which means you."}, {"blog_name": "tidelord-fr", "id": 162072738453, "date": "2017-06-21 04:40:17 GMT", "timestamp": 1498020017, "tags": ["discourse", "drama", "anon", "anonymous"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZIySrf2MyIRgL", "note_count": 0, "body": "Anon, if you wanna message I won't make a deal of it or fight but if not I'll just say this:\n\nToo many times in our community people jump to conclusions.

Though I never clearly saw moments where they were addressed with any pronouns, I really do believe they are meant to be non-binary and I will not disagree with anyone saying so.\nHowever, I strongly believe Frisk is meant to be the embodiment of the player, so the player should be allowed to see Frisk as whatever they want.

The concept is ridiculous to anyone\nwho is familiar with the nikkei experience. She was born there and has dual\ncitizenship, but she moved to America at age 3. She\u2019s a New York and Florida\nkid. She isn\u2019t fluent in the language or cultural intricacies of Japan, and\npointing that out isn\u2019t derailing the criticism of anti-blackness. Why can\u2019t\nJapan\u2019s racism and their ostracism of her be discussed without completely\nmisconstruing and disregarding the dynamic between Japanese Americans and Japan\nas a country? Or better yet, why can\u2019t we talk about Naomi Osaka as the\nmulticultural, multiracial individual she is? \nI am Japanese American. My extended family is Japanese Canadian. I\nhave cousins who are half white and half Latino, and my mother was half Chinese\n(and speaking of Chinese, if you think calling Naomi Osaka a gorilla is the\ncruelest extent of fucked up Japanese bigotry, there is some shit you haven\u2019t\nheard). I\u2019ve known other Japanese American kids at school. We might have kimono\nfolded up in the basement and miso paste in the fridge and a katana on the\nmantle, and we\u2019re starkly Japanese in the west against a white canvas, but nobody\namong us has any illusions that we can nihon buyo back to Japan and be embraced\nwith open arms, because we\u2019re not properly \nJapanese\n. A Japanese Canadian family\nfriend\u2019s goal was to become naturalized, and he was never able to attain\nJapanese citizenship no matter how hard he tried. My dad would go on business\ntrips to Tokyo as a foreigner, working for an American firm. We\u2019re like the\nnestlings in that old wives\u2019 tale, fallen from the tree and touched by a human\nand forever alien to the mother bird. We know acutely what it\u2019s like to not be\nwestern enough for the west nor Japanese enough for Japan. We hold on to\nheirlooms and shreds of heritage, but at the end of the day, if you grew up in\nAmerica, you\u2019re not much else but a Japanese-flavored American kid. And the\nhome of American kids is America\u2014never mind that maybe your grandparents met in\nan internment camp with their families\u2019 property stolen, or that maybe sometimes\nyou\u2019re treated like an exotic yellow subservient calculator, or that\nyou get constantly asked where you\u2019re \nreally\n from. You\u2019re here, and everything\nyou know and love is here. You\u2019re Japanese, but more fundamentally you\u2019re\nAmerican, and to pretend otherwise feels vaguely fraudulent. You can\u2019t just fly\nto Japan and settle in with your people, because they aren\u2019t your people\nanymore. The schism between being Japanese in Japan and being Japanese American\nis enormous, and sometimes I think people don\u2019t fully realize that. \nNaomi Osaka is just as much Asian American as she is Haitian\nAmerican. This site really annoys me sometimes. Like it\u2019s not okay to derail\nthe discussion of black issues by saying that, but it\u2019s fine to bulldoze over\nAsian American and mixed race topics? People are sounding appalled that a lot\nof Japanese aren\u2019t accepting her, or only superficially by merit of her tennis\nvictory, but of course she doesn\u2019t belong in Japan. She belongs with us in\nAmerica, where she was raised; she learned tennis on a New York court. That\u2019s\nhow it goes for all of us who grew up outside the country, regardless of whether or\nnot we are part black, and while anti-black bigotry in Japan is slathered on like\nshit icing on a trash cake, passive-aggressive xenophobia by Japan and cultural\ndisconnect are at their core not just a black issue. It\u2019s also an Asian\nAmerican one. \n\u201cI never know what to do when someone asks me where\nI\u2019m from. I just say FL, because saying Japan starts an unnecessary\nconversation.\u201d \nShe\u2019d rather say Florida because America is the home\nshe culturally identifies with, not Japan, which she can\u2019t even remember. Which\nisn\u2019t to say she\u2019s not Japanese\u2026 but she\u2019s Japanese in the way we often are on\nthis side of the Pacific. Fractured, reforged, recombinant. Her Haitian dad\nmade the decision for her to play for Japan instead of America for opportunity-related\nreasons. It wasn\u2019t something she chose as a personal statement. So shoehorning\nNaomi Osaka into the identity of \u201cblack Japanese\u201d and calling Japan her\n\u201chomeland\u201d and then getting outraged on her behalf when Japan won\u2019t let her\nlive up to the label isn\u2019t doing her a favor. It\u2019s also so disrespectful to\nstick a flag in her for \u201cblack discussion, non-blacks stay in your lane.\u201d She\u2019s\nnot just black (not to mention the potential topic of distinction between\nHaitian and black identities, which is its own kettle of fish). Her situation\nrepresents struggles for multiracial and culturally estranged people who never\nquite fit in anywhere, who are constantly being made uncomfortable by others\npressuring them to conform to groups that alienate them. She\u2019s an incredibly\nunique and inspirational individual, and I hate seeing her consigned to singular\nterritories of racial identity. If you want to use her to talk about\nexclusively black issues, then pick someone who\u2019s exclusively black. Blackness\nspecifically is not the only reason worth discussing as to why she doesn\u2019t gain\nacceptance over there, and please don\u2019t speak as though American-grown Japanese\nhave any expectation to belong \u201chome\u201d in Japan.

At my current (temporary) position, I'm helping the tech support department for a hospital swap out a bunch of old heart rate monitors (and adjacent equipment) for new, upgraded ones, and it got me thinking. The old stuff, of course, is going to be reused, with us packaging it up to be sent out to smaller regional clinics who are probably themselves upgrading to this from even older stuff. But it's actually the new ones that caught my attention; there's a whole assembly-line process to just unpacking and putting together the new stuff, but it's rather alarming how much junk is left over. Literal piles of packing foam, lots of cardboard boxes, (that we're at least reusing the big ones to package up the older monitors to send out) and then lots of miscellaneous stuff. The stand setup came with a bunch of different attachments for different mounting setups; since we're sticking to one consistent setup, two-thirds of the metal bars and arms and screws and what have you are now junk, thrown in the dumpster alongside the foam. The instruction booklets for assembly are redundant; that's a ton of paper waste. The cords and cables? In each box I pick out the power cord and converter, an HDMI cable and a USB, and then the other half are useless, either overly-specific stuff the hospital just plain isn't ever going to need, so there's no point in hanging onto, or a different type of power cord designed for european-style outlets instead. Why would that last one even need to be included if these aren't going to Europe? So that's a bunch of electronics junk too, all going in the dumpster.\nAnd it got me also thinking about like, home waste, and how I horde dead earbud sets I can't use because just throwing them in the trash feels like a waste, but the recycling plants certainly won't take them.\nAnd unfortunately there's not really anything we as consumers can do to change this individually. The \"reduce\" part of the recycling slogan is the one that's always felt the most useless to me, because everything is super heavily-packaged these days, they \nhave\n to be due to the realities of transportation and purchase unless you're super local and can get whatever directly from the source - not a privilege for most people.\nAnother form of pollution is all this physical stuff, the packaging that the purpose of runs out once the contents have arrived at their destination, and the highly-specific addon things that \ndo\n need to exist \njust in case\n, but are otherwise dead weight taking up resources and space because the production massively outstrips the demand. Some of it is recycled, but not every city has a recycling program, and there's so much more besides that's just clogging up space in landfills even as there's shortages of their exact component materials elsewhere in the world, meaning more mining and clearcutting and whatnot. In theory it's all recycleable too, but we're just not doing it, and half this stuff didn't need to be made in the first place because it's excess.\nAnd I just have to wonder how we're ever going to turn this around."}, {"blog_name": "earthfarran", "id": 164998700120, "date": "2017-09-05 04:46:09 GMT", "timestamp": 1504586769, "tags": ["discourse", "secrets of elvendale", "*text post", "cronan", "rosalyn", "**"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZKc_xc2Pgi5nO", "note_count": 125, "body": "I honestly can\u2019t believe that I have to say this but please do not\u00a0ship rosalyn/cronan, I understand that they had a cute sequence in the show but \ndo not\n ignore everything cronan did to her. they were awful and while she might forgive him it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll ever be able to forget it and they\u2019ll never be able to be in a healthy relationship.\u00a0\nnow instead, consider this: \nthem being friends,\u00a0\nwatching her slowly become comfortable with him again (but never to the full extent) and to see him grow and become a better person with rosalyn, and all the others, supporting him while simultaneously learning to forgive him.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "scoobydiscourse", "id": 166966290505, "date": "2017-10-31 02:16:06 GMT", "timestamp": 1509416166, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zga_ke2RVzsX9", "note_count": 2, "body": "people who prefer using lgbt as an acronym: please dont call us \u201cthe queer community\u201d\nyou homophobes: OUR VOICES WILL NOT BE SILENCED ANY MORE!

They're both great atheletes. \nI'm also not saying that what they did is wrong. They're both adults who can do as they please. \nWhat I'm trying to say is that their actions give a different idea of what it's like to be a JW. They paint this false image of freedom that nobody has access to unless they're rich. I would say they're like the Tom Cruise of JWs but they don't really champion for JWs the same way he does for Scientology. \nJWs face severe consequences, sometimes for very minor things. I don't know what it's like within the William's congregation but the fact that they call themselves Witnesses despite what they've done would lead me to believe that they haven't faced consequences within the congregation. Even if they were unbaptized they would face some sort of repercussions. I find it hard to believe that they would continue to claim to be Witnesses after being disfellowshipped or something along the lines. I feel like they wouldn't have seen any consequences if they're giving a lot of money to the congregation. That's just me though. \nEDIT: not only that but the fact that call themselves Witnesses, especially having family who are Witnesses as well, they should understand the implications of calling themselves a Witness and what it entails. And I'm sure that an elder would have talked to them saying \"hey you need to be careful with what you say,\" but the fact that she keeps calling herself doesn't help distancing her from the cult. If she's said something along the lines that she follows in practice after saying she is a Witness that would indicate some sort of backpedaling whether it's intentional or not (i.e. Saying you only follow in practice cause you were told to vs saying it because you were reprimanded in some way). Basically she knew what behavior Witnesses expected of each other and she still went and did what she wanted while calling herself one so I'm sus of her. \nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm not really calling them out as people but I am calling out their hypocrisy and their congregation's hypocrisy. The Williams sisters should know better that to engage in their behavior as Witnesses but probably also recognize that the only reason they get away with it is because of the money they donate to the organization and if that were the case that's a real shitty thing to do. \nI'm honestly surprised I haven't seen anyone else discuss this around here before.

For example, \n@keyhollow\n is trying to find facts debunking what I said (I doubt she can, since there\u2019s a lot of proof that lead me to my opinion but you never know) which is a great thing, she\u2019s one of the only people in this convo who isn\u2019t making my eyes roll constantly (although they sure rolled a few times lol) no need for insult (although, saying she\u2019s not bias would be ridiculous, she\u2019s clearly not coming from a neural nor objective stance)\nI can look up what I say and find proof, that\u2019s why my opinion is what it is. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m \u201cA stupid c*nt who should shut up\u201d (very brave dear anon(s?), imma delete your asks though since there\u2019s not much to reply to).\u00a0\nThere is no talking to most pro gun people since they do not want facts, they like their guns and that\u2019s all that matters to them.\u00a0\nYou can provide proof all you want, they\u2019ve made their decision and aren\u2019t willing to be open to new information or information that doesn\u2019t feed their narrative, which is why I\u2019m not going to attempt to talk logic with most.\u00a0\nSo yeah, stop getting angry to most and i\u2019m very exited to see what Keyhollow will bring to the table so this can either all end or maybe she\u2019ll change my opinion. (But also, saying \u201cyou\u2019ve never been here, you wouldn\u2019t know\u201d is really stupid.)"}, {"blog_name": "beijingnoodle", "id": 177039178454, "date": "2018-08-15 23:32:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1534375945, "tags": ["puns", "jokes", "discourse", "dildough", "doughdick", "help", "storytime", "applepie", "pilssberry", "vote"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZsieSa2auMthM", "note_count": 0, "body": "Discourse Time\nSo which pun is better: Dough dick or Dil-Dough?\nLemme explain.. my sister was making a pie.

Yeah people are upset about a bunch of shit right now, but leave the cast out of this.\n\nAs for the discourse, everyone needs to stop being so hateful towards each other. So what?

However, due to the fact that people disagree with each other, this fandom has become a massive toxic shit storm. If you don't like someone's content, don't follow them, it's that simple. You dont have to send hate or any of that shit.

It isn't about pathologizing the penis, or treating it like someone is an unthinking rape machine for having them. And it definitely has no place in it for anti-semitic, or otherwise fascist transphobes.\nFeminism is about abolishing the gender hierarchy in place, known as the patriarchy. It's about helping more feminine folks escape the shadow of oppression created by patriarchy while helping the more masculine population get around and escape from the harmful ways in which they're expected to perform masculinity. It is about supporting those who are entering womanhood from a more masculine role, as well as those leaving womanhood into a more masculine role. It is about supporting those who chose to adopt varying degrees of feminine and masculine roles, sometimes embodying the duality fully, or embodying almost none of the roles, or even taking on a completely new role.\nFor, you see, while patriarchy disproportionately privileges cis-men, and disadvantages women and GNC folk, it still cuts everyone in various ways. It does so, because it is a hierarchy with a normalized \"in-group\" that people are pressured to assert membership of, and an \"other\" that is cast as \"queer\" and as such, it is inherently oppressive."}, {"blog_name": "aya-tsuji", "id": 162802934074, "date": "2017-07-10 00:15:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1499645743, "tags": ["ace discourse", "asexual", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZZk0Dg2Ndpw4w", "note_count": 1, "body": "Also @ ace discourses blease stop using disabled people in your arguments we are not your pawns.

Free to be who I am, enjoy what I like, dress how I want, be the girl that I am.. without fear?\nI just don\u2019t get how insensitive you can be to the point of calling me selfish just for that...\n4. You call us homophobic.\nWhen I state that some lesbians are fine with trans women, I speak from what I have heard. I know more than a few lesbians who would be fine with trans women. There are dozens if not hundreds of lesbians who would be fine with trans women.\nIf you\u2019re gonna simply invalidate those dozens/hundreds of lesbians, how am I the homophobic one and not you? How am I sexist and not you?\nI\u2019ve dated a couple real lesbians, who saw me for a woman. So what?

For who I am, and thats not a healthy relationship to constantly be in fear of your partners thoughts.\nI would be find dating a bisexual woman, given I trust her very well, but I am not gonna instantly date any bi woman who asks me out.\n...\nWhy don\u2019t people just learn to let live, and let us be ourselves?

(that actually does make sense to begin with)\nThe answer is there is no problem with it, but people become so blinded by hate, or anger that they refuse to see things.\nI was raised in a homophobic household, where I was taught to hate and be disgusted by homosexual people. So I used to hate them, and be disgusted by them. I was so blinded by my hatred and disgust that I never saw 1. The biological aspect behind gay people, and 2.

Wp and white latinos will be treated differently globally)\nIve been thinking about how WP&white latines can struggle with self image and self worth because of xenophobia or racism or they just don't feel connected to their fellow LatAms or culture and how instead of understanding darker skinned latinos also experience this or that darker skinned latinos have struggles WP&White latines dont, they choose to be uncooperative or even racist. \nPeople will tell WP&White latinos they're white and they equate that with '\nnot able to interact with [x] culture.'\n Now, is that what most people mean? \nNo\n. People mean Wp&white latines undoubtedly get privileges darker skinned latines don't. The point isn't to tell someone raised in a mexican household they're too white to participate in their culture or too white to call themselves mexican. The point of darker skinned latines pointing out white/lightskin privilege is because WP&White latines use that privilege, whether intentionally or not, to get an advantage.\n And then wp&white people start getting all defensive because acknowledging other people's struggles under the same system feels like they're retracting anything they've gone through. There is no Olympics. We all can have emotions and feelings and be hurt by different statements but at the end of the day if you want to call yourself latine I personally think you should be willing to acknowledge that our siblings are being hurt and told to hate themselves and disadvantaged and erased in ways that are a mallet to fingers compared to our twisting of nails. And you should be willing to help them when they ask and sit down and listen to their struggles when they speak. \nPoint: wp&white latines, someone calling you white can feel disingenuous, and in some situations it can be (ie saying you ARENT Mexican/Honduran/whatever) but mostly it's saying you have privileges and if you refuse to acknowledge them because 'x has happened to me' you are a problem.\n \nThis isn't some calling rise to action message or any shit.

The thing is, though, that tommy still sounded very privileged. I believe that he has good intentions but he needs to sit back and listen to the POC community within his fanbase. \nPlease. Imagine you are in his shoes. He has anxiety and you can see that. How the hell do you think he is able to portray the anxiety his character in the lore has? He has just openly said to 100k people that ye goes to therapy and has anxiety about a lot of things and all i see is so many people making fun of tommy for it. \nI am all for holding him accountable. I have made it clear to myself that i will never ever hold a cc i watch to a giant standard because my parents and my old friends and everyone around me did that to me and while it isnt the same scale it is still so unbelievably anxiety inducing to be held to god like standards. Tommy is a good person and we all are able to see that but there are just some things that he doesn\u2019t know. and that is perfectly ok. There are so many things i didn\u2019t know at his age. Once upon a time i used to hear people around me saying slurs all the time and i thought nothing of it. It will not register in your head that you are being offensive until you know the exact meaning behind the slurs and words that you using. the micro aggressions you have. \nI just want to show how similar it was to karls stream because karl has openly talked about his anxiety and his adhd and during karl\u2019s stream you could see how anxious he was and that he keot on laughing nervously. now take that and remember it and watch how tommy talked. tommy kept saying the beginning of something and then back tracking and disagreeing and saying \u201cno no\u201d while karl was talkiing in a way where he stopped himself at certain points and had a quick though in his head. \nthey are very similar. the reason being is that they both have anxiety especially with them being two of the most popular streamers on twitch and having such a large following.\nanxiety tends to make you constantly think and rethink your decisions. it makes you scared to say the wrong thing. scared to say anything for that matter. anxiety is like your dog jumping on your bed only to get off again and then get back and then go. and then constantly do that. its those thoughts that you have that say \u201coh say this its good\u201d and \u201cno that was stupid why did you say that\u201d or \u201cwhy did you walk like that?\u201d or \u201cwhat if i came off too loud\u201d its those thoughts that always make you second guess every thing you say or do. \nTo clarify: \ni am not saying that you shouldn\u2019t be calling out tommy because i 100% believe he needs to talk about the \u201cschlatt bad\u201d bits and jokes he does. I am saying that when you call out and educate a creator you should do it with grace and empathy. because they are still people and human they have feelings and making fun of people having anxiety is really just mean. I am in no way trying to say that tommy doesnt deserve to be called out because he does. I just wanted to say this because it was really frustrating me seeing everyone sort of bash on him and his anxiety while he was trying to talk about something serious. because when you have to do something like that and at the scale he is at right now you tend to get a bit of tunnel vision and forgetfulness. \nanyways, please do not let this in anyway overshadow what you think about the situation going  on right now. let it guide you in how you proceed with it. \nand as always i am always open to talking with someone about it if i have said something wrong or anything. i was diagnosed with anxiety so i can understand how it feels especially having been put into smaller scale situations that are similar to this. anxiety sucks ass. but don\u2019t let it be an excuse. please still hold tommy accountable but do it respectfully"}, {"blog_name": "hinata-mochii", "id": 179268127456, "date": "2018-10-21 05:54:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1540101268, "tags": ["discourse", "tw: r*pe", "brett kavanope", "believe women", "trigger warning"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z2yhfd2czDehW", "note_count": 2, "body": "Felt like I should address this\nPeople who act like false r*pe accusations are the biggest and scariest problem men are facing rn are so incredibly uninformed it makes me sad.

I don\u2019t, really, but it is something that is worth trying to develop. I agree with SSC that the top candidate space is technological- AI, genetic engineering for smarts which makes any system massively better, or new systems for coordinating and communicating between people at mass scale. But \u201cwait untli technology saves us\u201d is dissatisfying, so I\u2019d at least want to be making some interesting talk about options in that last part.\nI do think there are some promising areas of the candidate space which are political, though. Straightforward voluntaryism of taxes doesn\u2019t work, but what \ncan\n you build out of voluntaryism, given the complex webs of social standing incentives that people will weave? Straightforward minarchism is anarchy minus the competing visions of property rights, which actually means jackbooted state enforcement just directed by the property owners rather than democracy (left-libertarians/anarchists often get this), but what \nother \nkinds of microkernel-states capable of swatting down \nanyone else\n trying to centralise that don\u2019t require abandoning all welfare\u00a0could be imagined and stable?\nMostly all I can really say is that the lack of an alternative answer is a problem which I and others sceptical of burn-the-system politics need to be really engaging with.

Anybody that wasn\u2019t within that\u00a0\u201cin-group\u201d was met with usually confusion and sometimes even hostility because somebody dared to insult (aka, rightfully criticize) their favorite show, and it was only a great time if you were either an aesthetic blog watching from the distance or if you were within one of the few accepted fandoms\nadditional edit: totally just remembered the entirety of\u00a0\u201ccallout culture\u201d which basically consisted of one user disliking another, so they would drag up any post they made (even if it was from like three years ago and they had apologized at least ten times since that post was made) that was Problematic and would get their own follower army to go send fucking anon hate to whatever user they didn\u2019t like... oh and uh, usually this was either minors fighting with each other, or grown adults harassing minors. obviously, both these situations were shitty in their own ways, but yeah no i genuinely remember grown adults harassing 15-16 year olds over problematic posts they made when they were 12. yes, this was a real thing."}, {"blog_name": "hadjii-blogs-undertale", "id": 164705871305, "date": "2017-08-28 08:50:24 GMT", "timestamp": 1503910224, "tags": ["language warning", "suicide warning", "meta", "discourse", "general trigger warning", "things get deep here and i'm sorry but i had to share how i feel"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zc6Lod2PPF2N9", "note_count": 5, "body": "[23 days later]\nIn reference to \nhttps://hadjii-blogs-undertale.tumblr.com/post/163800444030/\n@lynns-art-blog\n...\nAnd honestly, \n@everyone-needs-a-hoopoe\n because there's things in here that go for you too. Please read it through to the end. Or just skip to the very end at first and then go back and read through if you need.\nI really, really, really didn\u2019t actually want to get off my butt and do this, for multiple reasons. And not just cuz I\u2019m a lazy jackhole with depression who doesn\u2019t want to do anything in general. But recent events have brought things to a head, and I cannot remain silent any longer.\nFirst, I should like to clarify just where I stand as regarding the Undertale fandom.\nThe Undertale fandom is a beautiful thing. It is extremely imperfect but I love the fandom and will continue to do so for as long as I am able.\nSecond, I should like to clarify where I stand as regarding Undertale itself.\nIt will be difficult however, because I love Undertale more than I am capable of putting into any transferable medium that I know of.\nAm I a bit emotionally over-invested in Undertale?\nHeck. Yes.\nI also don't care that I am.\nUndertale has brought more joy and happiness and meaning to my life than literally anything else save my family who raised me and loves me, my religion, and a shortlist of friends, some of whom I only have so dear to my heart because of Undertale, so the point is moot.\nI can't say that Undertale cured my depression, because it didn't.\nWhat it did do is it showed me at a critical point in my life that there's something outside the grey murky mire.\nI'd considered myself an emotionally open person before Undertale. This was only vaguely true. Current me cannot comfortably say that old me was emotionally intelligent without severe disclaimers.\nOld me was an emotionally awkward dirtbag who had some idea of how to be a person but on the whole was completely clueless.\nI had forgotten how to feel. Like, really feel. And not just from the depression.\nI could occasionally get hits from certain songs and I absolutely lived for those moments but the songs would rapidly hit their saturation levels and I'd be cold again.\nThen Undertale came along. I loved the game long before I played it, discovering things about it slowly through an endless flood of my tumblr feed.\nIt looked like a rather good, cute, compelling little game. Eventually I decided to write a bit of fanfiction about it because it looked really good and I wanted to churn out what would happen if GLaD had an interaction with a murdery timeline.\nSo I went and researched. I dug and I dug and I dug. This wasn't all of my research, but on one particular tumblr alone I went through 700-odd undertale posts.\nBetween that and pouring out my heart and soul into the writing as I discovered just how much I could care about these things, or care in general really, I found that I'd left the door open, and something came back. A whole lot of something.\nUndertale is a Happy\u2122 game about Happy\u2122 things.\nI had learned that maybe sad things weren't all bad back from the days of Background Pony.\nThe difference being, Background Pony had a disappointing, absurd ending.\nThey'd won the right even by my sappy heart to have a sad ending, then they completely botched it.\nI'd associated one of the most significant songs I know of with it, and they failed terribly.\nBut Undertale had a good ending.\nAs aggravating as it is to not be able to keep Asriel, much less Chara, in the bounds of the game itself, that's part of the point of the ending.\nSo there was no knee-jerk shock.\nWhile it is true that in a practical Undertale implementation, unbounded by the Game Maker engine, fuelled by the raw power of Determination, human spirit, and imagination, surely something more could have been achieved.\nBut that does not take away from the coherent ending of Undertale.\nThere is a lot of pain in Undertale. So much pain.\nIt is overwhelming and vivid and searing and scorching and so very, very tangible and understandable and real.\nNot that the events of the game are real, well, as far as I can tell. The emotions are deep and real, I mean.\nThis was to me as the gas leak was to Vinny Santorini in Atlantis.\nDue to the combined pressure of the mental overhaul Undertale was giving me, and the softness and vulnerability it re-introduced, throwing in re-learning certain cold facts about how much the powers-that-be at my previous job didn't care about doing good work, only making money, more severely than I had previously believed from last year, I lost my ability to continue driving there and showing up every day.\nNow, due to the way the contract works, and my having left the job gracefully, I am free to go back whenever I want. I was not fired. There are many employees who just go there, work as long as they can, then leave and wait for next season to come back. Their efforts are appreciated, especially when all heck breaks loose at the beginning of the on-season because all the bugs in the software that weren't found yet are harsly exposed.\nWhat happened with me is not ideal, nor is it rare or even unusual at this place. In about 3 months I could walk in the door and they'd welcome me with a smile and I'd get back to politely telling people that they're wrong and clueless and fixing their crap for them and half the time doing their job for them. (as if that's terribly different than my current job... just in person now instead of over a phone)\nAnyways, so, Undertale hurts.\nLoving Undertale so deeply hurts a lot.\nBut it's also happy. It has so much happiness. It's so bright and wonderful. It's a warm, soft, fuzzy hug from goatmom and a slice of butterscotch pie. It's making spaghetti with Papyrus, only using an actual recipe this time and making it turn out well. It's watching anime until 4 am with Alphys and Undyne and suppressing giggles at seeing the two precious gay babies asleep and cuddling. It's hugging Sans and telling him it'll be okay. It's having a lovely tea party with Asgore and Muffet.\nIt's kissing a sad sapient golden flower on the forehead, buying a bar of chocolate and raising it in the air as a toast before eating it.\nBittersweet happiness sometimes but so very, very good and I love it and I really cannot get enough.\nI'm addicted. Addicted to feeling again.\nAs the band Ghost says, \"From the pinnacle to the pit, it is a long way down.\"\nI haven't been to the absolute bottom, in that I haven't been institutionalized/hospitalized/just straight up killed by my depression,\nBut I have been in the shower for 4 hours before from 2 am to 6 am at college, for one thing, so uhhh,\nnobody can say that I'm utterly clueless about such things without looking like a lunatic.\nhttps://hadjii-blogs-undertale.tumblr.com/post/164567314340\nPosts like the above still rip my heart out every time I see them. I've long since re-associated the song mentioned earlier with this particular point of note of Chara.\nIt's not entirely pleasant, no, but it makes me feel so alive and real and like I'm an actual human being and not an emotionless, soulless automaton covered in flesh.\nAnd the happy posts are just that much brighter because of the contrast.\nhttps://hadjii-blogs-undertale.tumblr.com/post/164689197750\nhttps://hadjii-blogs-undertale.tumblr.com/post/164498003145\nhttps://hadjii-blogs-undertale.tumblr.com/post/164161681835\nhttps://hadjii-blogs-undertale.tumblr.com/post/164061257705\nSome people can get by on just fluff alone. There's nothing wrong with that. This is just the way I personally operate. As for me, I've had too much saccharine positivity and \"oh dont be sad everything is completely fine and theres nothing to be sad about youre not depressed just get up and go to work son!\"\nsorry got sidetracked and a little oddly specific there\nanyways\nSo the point is from the above wall of text that I have a lot of investment in Undertale and it means a lot to me.\nNow, it's time for me to pull receipts.\nOne receipt, to be exact.\nOn a semifamous Undertale blog, that I still have not responded to, and quite possibly never will, unless you count this post as a response.\nhttp://charadreemurr.tumblr.com/post/157052680490\nI literally couldn't even read their last response for a solid two months because my eyes would skim off the words because they were full of so much utter crap.\nWhen I did, I was sorry for it, because it was still so much crap.\nAnd no, this isn't like the average tumblr receipt pull, because a lot of the time, a given person has changed for the better, and the receipts you're pulling are for a dramatically different person.\nThis person has not changed and as best as I can tell will never change, or at least not for the next decade or so, unless something dramatic happens.\nThey were the OP of the twitter bustercluck. If you don't know, don't ask, because I don't feel like getting into that right now. I may do so later though in a different post.\nAll I was trying to do was share a little positivity, and I was met with discourse, hostility, and self-righteousness.\n\"And second \u201cbiological gender\u201d is a statement rife with discontent-\"\nPardon my french but wtf m8?\nSince then I have learned more thoroughly that in more modern usage, that sex and gender don't have ambiguity and don't need \"biological\" and \"identity\" modifiers for clarification, so to a limited extent, they were correct.\nHowever, this does not excuse their behavior. There are many people, myself included back then, that because of their upbringing are uncomfortable saying the word \"sex\" in any context. I am not now, but I was then, which is why I used \"gender\" with modifiers for clarification. I gave them multiple chances in earlier reblogs to realize that I was just trying to share a bit of happiness. I clearly conveyed the belief that what's in one's pants doesn't necessarily align with what's in one's head and that it's not a problem. I also clearly stated that when referring to Frisk and Chara, one should use they/them.\nAnd yet, they chose to perceive a threat where there was none.\nThey prefaced their statement with \"Yikes\"\nthen \"Im gonna assume the best here though because i wanna assume people are good\"\nAnd completely did not follow through on that.\nStatement rife with discontent, indeed.\nI was rather hurt by this. Especially, especially because of the uniqueness of their url. They are the one and only charadreemurr. That's a very particular title, and they ought to live up to it.\nAnd here, they did not. Unless Chara Dreemurr really is supposed to be a pretentious self-serving self-righteous paranoid uptight jackhole of a binch. In which case, congratulations, they succeeded.\nI showed the post to a different trans friend of mine, and they were shocked by the post as well, looked through their tumblr, and declared the person \"basically their least favorite type of person\".\nTo this day, I feel uneasy just seeing the word \"yikes\" sometimes.\nI have mentioned it a few times to some people but this really sent me for a loop. I almost left the fandom on the spot, like far too many good people have done when they were burned by the toxic side of the fandom.\nAnd honestly, if I'd lost Undertale at such a key point in my life, with my job already falling apart, and the other crap I was going through at the time, especially with the election, I cannot safely say that I'd still be here. With the friends that I wouldn't have made solid yet, I probably would have attempted suicide.\nAnd believe me, I'm an engineer. I would not have survived. Knives, pills, guns, rope, water, heights, motor vehicles, police, fire, bleach, all are too unreliable for me. I know exactly how I would do it, if I were to ever do it.\nYeah, I know, it's not anyone's job to make sure I don't commit suicide beyond my own.\nPeople who threaten others with their own suicide are horribly manipulative.\nI am not threatening anyone with my suicide here.\nI'm not saying \"ermagersh dont break up with me or ill literally kill myself\"\nWhat I am saying is \"X happened to me in the past and it's made me want to kill myself\"\nSuicide baiting someone is a terrible thing to do.\nAccidental baiting someone is not someone's fault, as it's accidental, but generally one should try to avoid it.\nVery similar to triggering somebody.\nDon't trigger people.\nIf you do, apologize, and do better in the future, and be more consistent about tags and crap.\nJust for the record, due to that and other things that have happened to me, I know that I am not now and not ever going to die by my own hand.\nBecause, I stood up. I turned around. And like Captain America, I said \"No. You move.\"\nWell, in my head. I didn't actually say anything to them.\nAnd I stayed.\nAnd that has made all the difference.\nI have a great job now that pays moderately well. I have a wonderful aspec girlfriend now.\nMy life still sucks in so many ways but I actually oftentimes see a light at the end of the tunnel.\nThe world is crap and it's going to get crappier but not everything will be bad forever.\nNow, we get to the center of the issue, having explained some needed context.\nNonbinary Frisk and Chara.\nI love nb Frisk and Chara.\nI have not and will never make a Frisk or Chara that is anything but nb.\nAt one point, a certain Frisk was going to maybe use She/They (or He/They, hadn't decided yet) instead of just They when they became a parent, but I scrapped that idea long before any of this.\nIt is completely correct to use they/them pronouns when talking about Frisk and Chara in general. These are all that are used in the game itself.\nThe pertinent question though is does this mean that Frisk and Chara are canonically nonbinary, and what of people who make variants/instances that aren't nonbinary?\nThus far, most of the argument I've seen in favor of nonbinary being a forcible requirement is only slightly more solid than claiming that the Boss in the Saints Row series must be nonbinary, as an example.\nYes, it is true that in SR2 and later, one chooses the boss's sex.\nHowever, they also choose a voice, and the voice doesn't necessarily have to match the physical sex. Trans and NB Bosses are completely plausible within the game's canon. All dialogue just refers to the Boss as They/Them, regardless of player choice, to the best of my knowledge. Or just refers to them as \"The Boss\". In SR:GOOH, Satan (yes, the literal Prince of Darkness, ruler of literal actual Hell) refers to The Boss as \"They\" so yeah. Anyways.\nHonestly the strongest argument I've seen in favor of NB Frisk and Chara being canon is \"Because NB people could use the representation!\"\nWhich boils down to \"Because I said so!\"\nWhich boils down to \"Because f*** you, that's why\"\nNow, I personally love this reasoning and I'm already on board, but with three quirks.\n1. I can see why other people may not be so satisfied with this.\n2. I cannot see this as an absolute requirement preventing any other possible interpretation of Frisk and Chara being okay.\n3. I do not find this a remotely strong enough reasoning to condone attacking other people over it.\nI personally headcanon NB Frisks and Charas being by far the dominant kind across the entire Undertale trunk.\nAnd I look across the internet at the many, many wonderful creative people who have instanced Frisk and Chara, and I see that this is so.\nAnd this is how it should be.\nFrisk and Chara are excellent NB representation.\nI quite firmly believe Tobyfox intended this to be so, and created them as such.\nOn a side note, I just found out the \"my last wish for undertale is that when discussion of it fades it dies peacefully instead of morphing into a garbage cesspool\" tweet was faked.\nProbably should've figured that out a long time ago, that's not quite how toby tweets.\n...\nAnyways,\nhttps://twitter.com/UnderTale/status/644614840925978624\nTobyfox, the one who made Frisk and Chara so readily NB, who put so much NB representation into the game in general, did not ask for this. He did not create them to be sticks to beat others with. They were a gift of kindness. To say \"Hey. Hey you. You matter and are important and are valid. Have two complex characters who have no indicated and strongly ambiguous gender, not even barriers blocking a particular interpretation.\"\nThats the kicker. No barriers blocking a particular interpretation. The road goes both ways.\nFrisk and Chara were meant to be characters one identified with.\n\"It's me, Chara.\"\n\"It's you!\"\nFrisk and Chara ought to be NB, yes.\nUnless otherwise specified, they're NB.\nThing is, not everyone who plays Undertale is nb.\nreal shocker there yeah\nPoint is, hurting someone who's not nb for identifying with Chara or Frisk is on the same level of behavior as yelling at someone for being kin with the same character as someone else, or yelling at someone for selfshipping with the same character as someone else.\nIt's immature, unkind, greedy, and completely unnecessary. Even illogical.\nEven if Frisk and Chara were real in their own timelines and not just pixels on a screen, there are an infinite number of instances and infinite number of variations of them.\nEven if infinities don't appease one, and they demand to examine the situation proportion/representation-wise, NB Frisk and Chara dominate the multiverse.\nAnd if that does not satisfy, then what will?\nEven if the entire infinite expanse was filled solely with nb Charas and Frisks, and there was only one Frisk across the trunk who was not nb, because they were created by one author in memory of a cis person who played and loved Undertale and fought through the entire game reset after reset, in a fruitless effort to save Asriel, will you rip that from their hands, in the name of \"equal representation\"?\nWill you be like David in the bible, who had more than anyone could ask for, and lost it all because he wanted one last thing? One more person to be theirs as well?\nThere is a song by Tool which is very relevant here.\nhttps://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tool/rightintwo.html\n\"Don't these talking monkeys know that\nEden has enough to go around?\nPlenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys,\nWhere there's one you're bound to divide it.\nRight in two.\"\nI'm sorry, but I cannot condone vitriol over this.\nI cannot condone such hateful attitude and behaviors.\nJust like the antifa who was punched by another antifa at a protest because they judged them by mere appearance to be a fascist, hatred doesn't accomplish anything.\nThere are times and places when due to the actions of other people, there is no valid choice remaining but violence.\nThis is seen in Undertale.

Can y'all please destroy all the ridiculous intra-community arguments that will not even help us progress in any way, pretty pretty please? \n\n\nSeriously, I\u2019ve seen like 5 older LGBT+ people commenting on how ridiculous all of us younger LGBT+ peeps on tumblr have been with the \u201cdiscourse\u201d which at this point has become an excuse to police people and exclude different people for NO GOOD REASON. \n\n\nThe ONLY reason discourse exists is because some people don\u2019t feel special anymore so they\u2019re seeking out other people with \u201cspecial snowflake\u201d labels and blaming them for their own inferiority complex. \n\n\nLike, we get it Shannon, you\u2019re gay so why are you picking on someone who\u2019s bisexual? What\u2019s the point? Where is it getting you? How are you helping the LGBT+ community get better? Why are you discounting ALL of the LGBT+ history that exists in the world just to support your nonsensical argument? Do you understand intersectionality? Why be supportive of one sexuality or gender identity and not others? Why tell people to make their own separate community and then raid their tags and steal their terms and then mock them? \n\n\nDo you not realize that Tumblr is not the real world? Privilege, oppression, and all that stuff doesn\u2019t always work the way you think it does just because you write it on a post and you get thousands of notes. As someone who is Latinx and LGBT+, my experience with oppression in real life is nothing like how it\u2019s described on tumblr. Like, barely. Maybe there are a few relatable posts from other Latinx people but in the end, REAL LIFE is nothing like Tumblr. \n\n\nEveryone is going to have individual experiences that cannot be categorized by a bunch of kids with blogs. Overall, LGBT+ people will always be targets, especially if they\u2019re people of color. That\u2019s a fact. BUT, each of us will face a different version of oppression and discrimination individually because we are not all one being. \n\n\nSo the next time you engage in discourse and go, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand because you\u2019re not blah blah blah,\u201d remember that you\u2019re helping that oppression and discrimination stay strong because of your need to feel more important than another human being AND THAT\u2019S SELFISH. \n\n\nEveryone has a different story. Everyone is an individual with their own stories and experiences. Anyone who identifies under any part of the LGBT+ community is valid, regardless of what kind of discrimination and oppression they\u2019ve been through. There is no such thing as being \u201cgay\u201d enough to be in this community. There should not be any special \u201choops\u201d for people to jump through like a damn circus poodle just to join this community. You\u2019re not straight? You\u2019re in! You\u2019re not cisgender? You\u2019re in! You want to take your time to really find your identity (you\u2019re questioning)? You\u2019re in! You consider yourself straight because it make sense to you? Awesome! You can still be a great ally! \n\n\nStop building fake barriers and using transparent arguments just so you can stroke your own ego and feel \u201cspecial\u201d. Like, go sit down, chill out, eat a damn cookie, and figure out a better game plan to support the LGBT+ community without throwing people under the bus. Call people out when they are actually being douchey, not when you slightly disagree with them and you wanna make a big deal out of it. One person calling you a name from another community does not = all of that community thinks the same thing. I\u2019m pretty sure the people of that community can call out their own people on their ridiculousness. \n\n\nSo, to some of the older LGBT+ people who have been destroying the arguments and reminding us why this community was formed: THANK YOU! PLEASE KEEP DOING WHAT YOU\u2019RE DOING BECAUSE IT\u2019S STARTING TO WORK."}, {"blog_name": "elliesdigitalgarbagedump", "id": 180813436594, "date": "2018-12-05 03:01:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1543978910, "tags": ["tumblr", "discourse", "female presenting nipples", "wtf"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZYxOxv2ePKXQo", "note_count": 57, "body": "Who else remembers when the largest \u201cfuck you\u201d from staff before this discourse was when they made the blue 6 shades darker? \nSuch simpler times: no yahoo, no ads. \nAnd it\u2019s not that I even have a problem with yahoo or the site trying to create revenue via ads or being advertiser friendly, either!

people and everyone taking it as they endorse their actions, and, like bbh said, just because you're friends with them doesn't mean you automatically support every shit thing they do. trust me, i've had friends who've done shitty things and i've had to speak to, just because you're friends with somebody who's a shitty person doesn't mean you're going to say they're not in the wrong, and it's very stupid for these people to be assuming that the cc's do when they don't know that- when they don't know them for sure. and then he spoke about the tommy situation, and he said that he's been going through a lot of mental stress due to everything that's been going on, and spoke about how he doesn't care about holding people accountable but there's a point where people need to just chill. and that's exactly how i feel about it. people forget that these cc's are actual people, who have feelings and are going to have emotional responses to things- and yes, i know that's crazy to believe /s- in favor of ruthlessly harming them in guise of \"educating\". and yes there's some people who do educate- who simply hold cc's accountable but also there's people who take it too far and don't fucking realize that they aren't talking to just a blank slate of a person, they're talking to a human fucking being who just happens to have a platform- a 17yr old kid. who isn't going to be perfect, who's going to make stupid jokes like this, and is going to be overwhelmed when, amongst the people who are trying to educate him, is genuinely nasty people telling him nasty things, because yes, i saw some horrible, horrible shit under #tommy neg. and that's not to say that tommy didn't do anything wrong, because he's hurt minorities with his schlatt jokes, and that's completely valid, but the point of this isn't to debate over that, the point of it is that some of y'all take it too fucking far. some of y'all don't take a second and realize that these are real people you're slamming and over analyzing their every word and twisting shit out of context, and tommy has a million eyes watching him- a huge platform of people who are there to view when he slips and messes up, and that's incredibly fucking stressful and people don't talk about that enough. cut the cc's some god damn slack if it's a genuine mistake that they can learn from- that they seem willing to learn from. please. because hearing bbh talking about how stressed this has made tommy hurts me, like actually. i didn't want any of this to affect him and it turns out it has and i'm just sort of tired of the people in this community who will take situations where a cc messes up and shout over the people who are trying to educate and cause genuine harm. fuck you lot. and to the minorities in this community , i'm sorry you have to deal with people like that- i'm sorry they're so loud and outweigh the help you're trying to provide. cc!bbh and tommy get behind me "}, {"blog_name": "wyohippie", "id":

I\u2019ve been struggling all day to make sense of what I want to say\u2026but I do feel compelled to say something. \u00a0These tragedies must be discussed, and the internet is on fire with reactions to these various tragedies; I admit, I wonder if the last tragedy, and the last 5 names are not a reaction to the first two tragedies, and names. \u00a0 Unfortunately, much of what I have read today increases the divisions, although there are some who have attempted to reflect more thoughtfully. \u00a0The BLM movement seems to focus exclusively on the issue of unarmed (or admittedly armed), or subdued \u201csuspects\u201d many of whom are subdued as a result of \u00a0existing while brown, not for any reasonable suspicion\u2026I do not believe a tail light is a legitimate reason to murder a man. \u00a0But I think my issue is that I either must be all in for the BLM movement (and thus not grieve for the dead police officers), or all in for the police, and not address the systemic racism that exists in the US (or grieve for murdered men), and especially in the police force. \u00a0Why can\u2019t I be appalled by both?\nTo be clear, I am not on the side of #alllivesmatter, I understand that this movement is a misunderstanding of the reason that BLM is important. \u00a0The BLM movement acknowledges that the number of ethnic minority people (especially black people) incarcerated, and charged, and murdered by the police is problematic. \u00a0We, in this country have a problem with unnecessary force among some police officers, although I have also interacted with really good police officers who are avoid these biases. \u00a0 We MUST address the systemic injustice, the systemic racism, our judicial system disproportionately focuses on ethnic minorities, and people who live in poverty; it is much easier to avoid legal charges if you have the money to fight\u2026it\u2019s much easier to replace a tail-light when you aren\u2019t living pay check to pay check. \u00a0\nSo what? \u00a0What do we do? \u00a0 A professional colleague from a list serve I am on called for action he said\u00a0\"Where are all of you who call yourselves multiculturalists, social justice advocates, and advocates for those who are treated unjustly? Are we Black men not important enough to get your anger up not to talk but to take action? Where are you when you are needed most?\u2026Do Something.

yeah, that\u2019s going to do a world of good.\nrlly hope the blood on your hands is worth a few corny jokes."}, {"blog_name": "tsundere-bellwether", "id": 646838649739231232, "date": "2021-03-27 19:30:07 GMT", "timestamp": 1616873407, "tags": ["rwby spoilers", "rwby crit", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZNArbbZw25Ceiq00", "note_count": 6, "body": ".\nThe nuts and dolts song is titled Friend\nEven if she comes back, they're not getting together lmfao"}, {"blog_name": "wet-raccoon", "id": 163231236044, "date": "2017-07-21 00:06:36 GMT", "timestamp": 1500595596, "tags": ["anti klance", "discourse", "let Keith have his fucking spot light you don't know how much it means for asians to see a main Asian character LEAD", "lmao just say you self insert as him and go"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZeK6vp2O1Ll-C", "note_count": 3, "body": "Voltron: *has a plot point centered around keith*\nKl/Ancers: hmmm, how can we make this about Lance under the guise of shipping?"}, {"blog_name": "whumpster-fire", "id": 669059251537362944, "date": "2021-11-28 01:57:04 GMT", "timestamp": 1638064624, "tags": ["discourse", "vent"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z_w3gUb8_TWjai00", "note_count": 2, "body": "Sometimes I read about fucked-up historical practices like public executions, hangings of teenagers over stealing a loaf of bread being treated as a spectator sport, mutilation and branding, etc, and think \u201cWow, what the fuck was wrong with people in the past, how the fuck could anyone support this shit?\u201d\nAnd then I go on social media for 30 minutes and I\u2019m like \u201cOh.

I don\u2019t see why these statements can\u2019t co-exist.\n(Long post warning)\nForced feminization is a \nhuge\n \u201cconversion therapy\u201d tactic used against trans guys to try and convince them that they\u2019re really \u201cjust women\u201d. I\u2019ve had this used against me, I\u2019ve had feminine names pushed on me, I\u2019ve had lots of aspects of femininity pushed on me. This was to \u201cremind\u201d me that really everyone will always see me as woman. I\u2019m not alone in this. Many trans men experience this, it\u2019s a very real trauma. \nMost trans guys don\u2019t want to be seen as \u201cfeminine\u201d, certainly while they\u2019re out and about - it\u2019s often a trigger for dysphoria. Trans men want to be seen as men. Masculine trans men are often perceived as dangerous for simply being masculine. This is a truth. Trans men can enjoy being masculine, and they can also suffer from it as a result.\nAT THE SAME TIME it is true that, for many people in many different places, masculine trans men is the \u201cdefault\u201d. The only safe way to live is to be stealth, and that is to be masculine. To be seen as GNC would be dangerous, even should they want to be. It is true that feminine or otherwise GNC trans men are often not viewed as \u201ctrans enough\u201d. It often used against them \u201cproof\u201d that \nreally\n they\u2019re women. While Cis men, certainly in western countries (mostly by white people in white areas tbh) are being celebrated for embracing femininity, trans men are often admonished for it.\nFrom personal experience the pressure to be masculine is real. I like many things that would be considered feminine, I\u2019d like to wear things that would be considered feminine, and I hate myself for it. Because it\u2019s not manly enough, I\u2019m not \u201ctrans enough\u201d, because it\u2019s been drilled in me I have to be completely and totally masculine - at times to a toxic degree. I\u2019m not the only trans man who\u2019s experienced this. \nThe statements \u201cTrans men should be allowed to be masculine, there is no harm in a trans man loving being masculine, masculinity isn\u2019t a threat to anyone, trans men aren\u2019t inherently dangerous for being masculine, trans men are often forced to be feminine, and being associated with femininity can cause dysphoria for some trans men\u201d and \u201cTrans men should be allowed to be feminine, there is no harm in a trans man loving to be feminine, just because a trans man likes feminine things doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re faking being trans, trans men should not be attacked or put in danger physically or otherwise for not conforming to their gender\u201d can exist at the same time!\nLike sweet Aragorn eating a Canoly. People are going to find reasons to hate us regardless of whether or not you present masculine or feminine. People are going to misgender a lot of us regardless of how we present. We should be able to talk about our struggles and experiences presenting masculine, \nbeing\n masculine, without being attacked by other trans men who have different experiences. The reverse is equally true for GNC trans men. Why are we turning on each other? \nI get like 5 \u201ctrans men should be masculine! Trans men don\u2019t owe you femininity! We should celebrate masculine trans men!\u201d Posts a day. We should celebrate masculine trans men! We don\u2019t owe anyone femininity. I\u2019ve seen people screenshot these posts and ridicule them for \u201ccomplaining about being default\u201d and that\u2019s really fucked up.\nI\u2019ve also seen, less than the former, posts celebrating feminine trans men on my dash. Almost always there are comments/screenshots with comments about how you must \u201chate yourself for being a man\u201d to be feminine, or how they \u201caren\u2019t really a trans guy\u201d, or how they have privilege when they go out or some shit along those lines. Which is fucked up! \nWhy can\u2019t we can\u2019t get along? It won\u2019t be long before we revert back to the fucking truscum/tucute whatever garbage discourse again. As someone who\u2019s more in the middle of all this discourse, who resonates with GNC and Masculine trans men, who just wants nuanced discussions and to be able to talk about the individualized & specific experiences or struggles of either party without it immediately triggering discourse - can we please just use our brains! Not everything is worthy of a block post, people don\u2019t owe you an explanation or the feeling of guilt for existing. \nTrans men don\u2019t owe anybody Femininity. Trans men don\u2019t owe anybody Masculinity. Trans men don\u2019t owe anybody anything.\nThese statements can and should co-exist. I\u2019m tired of seeing in fighting on my dash because one trans man wants to be a lumberjack man and another wants to wear pastels. Both should be celebrated, all trans men should be uplifted.

While people can go back and forth about how it \nshould\n be, at the end of the day this is the founding tenet of the site and people should interact with it on those terms: as an unmoded space where the onus is placed on readers rather than the content creators. As a repository of fic, the archive would rather host as much fic as possible and turn off some readers rather than make itself palatable to all readers by getting rid of the \u2018not really fic at all just torture porn/cp with famous character names slapped on top of it\u2019 genre, because in getting rid of that genre they will by necessity also end up accidentally deleting a lot of actual fic that has \u2018problematic\u2019 elements, ie underage sex and sexualized violence. \nBy being geared more towards the hosting and preservation of fic and rather than the safety and comfort of the reader, ao3 by necessity alienates a lot of people. This alienation is compounded by the fact that ao3 has become \nthe\n place to read and host fic, something which probably wasn\u2019t the original intent, but an outcropping of being the only archive ran by and for fans.  \nIt is impossible for ao3 to be both an all-encompassing omnibus of fic \nand\n a place where fans of all ages can be perfectly safe; these two ideals are in a sense contradictory. However, ao3 does not strike a \u2018happy medium\u2019, perhaps veering too far towards the \u2018all fic content is fine\u2019 side by showing summaries and tags in full during browsing, thus potentially exposing readers to triggering and disturbing content that they did not click on and this consent to (who hasn\u2019t seen a tag reading \u2018x #### in ys mouth\u2019 for example and then been deeply disturbed for the rest of the day, or a blatantly pornographic pedophilic summary?). \nIt should be borne in mind that most antis are young, and likely have been deeply disturbed by things they stumbled upon on ao3, and are trying to make their own fan experience more comfortable for themselves. As time goes on and new fans are introduced to fandom, the events that inspired the fierce anti-moderation spirit in the founders of ao3 turn more and more into ancient history that these new fans are either unaware of or can\u2019t connect to (see LiveJournal Strikethrough/Boldthrough 2007), and thus a schism is born. \nIf ao3 cannot, and should not, be all things to all people, then perhaps the ideal solution would be for there to be another archive out there, as good and useable as ao3 is, that \nis\n centered around catering to reader comfort and safety. But first someone would have to build it, and that would be a monumental task in both time, skilled labor, and money. \nI end this quasi-academic essay with no solution, only my own opinion: while I feel sympathy for antis, and people from other, less free-speech centric countries where some of the content on ao3 is downright \nillegal, \nao3 as it is now means a lot to me and to other people. I don\u2019t want it to change, I don\u2019t want it to be moderated, because the idea of my favorite fic being lost to the sands of time genuinely distresses me. While there are things that can be improved to make us all more comfortable, nothing about the way it is now greatly impacts my enjoyment. That probably means that I\u2019m speaking from a privileged position; it\u2019s definitely a biased one. But ao3 was built by a group of fans as a labor of love, that they gave to the world for free.

This is a vent post. I am going to express my frustration here. \nI just logged on and saw the reactionary mess in regards to AO3 surpassing their donation goal. One post in particular called the fact that they surpassed their goal by so much \"disgusting\" and wished ill on everyone who donated, which to me is an INCREDIBLE take for a few reasons.\nI can understand feeling upset that people's individual posts asking for help paying a month's rent often struggle to reach much lower sums while AO3 got way more money in a matter of days. But the reasoning used to get to \"everyone who donated to AO3 is evil\" is stunning to me.\nIt's like being mad that NPR or Wikipedia surpassed their donation goals.\nIf we're comparing individual funds to AO3s donation drive, there's the major difference of AO3 having a HUGE user base, and thus wayyyyyyy more exposure than individual posts. The same percentage of people who interact who donate translates to a wildly different sum of money for each.\nIf we're comparing to other non-profits, first of all none of the posts I've interacted with so far have actually compared the amount that each got at their most recent donation drives, and second, a lot of the non-profits mentioned push for donations on an ongoing basis. There's a big difference between the revenue generated by a donation drive, which is a singular event, and constant campaigning.\nThat's not even mentioning possibly the biggest logical fallacy of the whole argument: the posts I've seen have almost all been phrased as though all the people who are currently donating to AO3 never donate to anything else.\nAll I can say to that is take a step back and evaluate that statement.

That\u2019s a \nlot\n of effort they put into the game. Noxcrew removed that feature. \nEvery single time Dream is the team leader so to speak he\u2019s tried to have a strategy for Buildmart.

So if you ever claimed to care that Grian got a panic attack during Dodgebolt (which yeah it\u2019s so high pressure and I\u2019m glad he was okay to keep playing) then you can\u2019t just dismiss Dream\u2019s also very real reaction to Buildmart over stimulating him. And now he keeps his music off and tries to make sure his team knows what\u2019s up even if ADHD brain makes him immediately forget everything he said the moment he leaves the build room. \nIdk what more people want from him. He doesn\u2019t like the game. He wishes they\u2019d change up the game they way they have for literally almost every other game. They took away his baby Parkour Warrior and he gets why. It stopped being fun for a lot of people. But again there are usually what two teams who are excited for Buildmart? Even the people who are indifferent usually just want to get the game over with because they find no fun in it.\nAlso if Dream wants to step back for an MCC? He\u2019s firstly allowed to do whatever he wants and secondly all you assholes who hates him blindly should be happy no?

People are allowed to be uncomfortable with the word \"queer\".\nI spent 5 years, as a kid, pretty much every day being called \"gay\" as a disparaging thing just because of a convenient rhyme. It was about a year after that I first noticed I was pan (I'm amab with a strong preference for women, so my realisation came from hanging out with other bi people and assessing my feelings rather than from unexpected attraction), and even at that time I was confused about the implications of the title \"queer as folk\".\nStill, as I grew up I felt very uncomfortable with queer as a way of describing me or other gay people. I never had it aimed at me but I often saw it used to mean \"fucked up/wrong\", and etymology is important to me so I always felt *super* uncomfortable with the fact that it meant \"weird\" or \"strange\", and that's why it became a term for us. Gay meant something else, it meant happy, it meant loud, it meant bright, it meant the exact atmosphere that has come to embody Pride parades. That's an easy thing to reclaim and adjust your perspective on.\nAnd honestly in this world where straight cis people can be so awful, I can understand people being empowered by the word and the implication that they're different from the awful average. But I just.. I love being bi and pan and maybe more and I love not being what a lot of people would consider \"normal\", but with my whole entire heart I believe this is a place where we should be breaking down barriers and *making* \"normal\" have space for us, rather than just accepting the idea that we're inherently \"other\".\nAnd I've always had these feelings and always had this discomfort, but over the past few years I've seen more and more talk about how \" \"q slur\" is terf rhetoric\" and... It's a whole portion of the community that has been thrown up and abandoned and treated as \"this is wrong, if you can't condemn it then the TERFs can have you bc you should know it's disgusting\".\nWe're the fucking community of outcasts, we're the last people who should be playing purity culture. Like, of course we should have no room for actual bigotry, but we're allowed to disagree about language. . I don't know how common this belief is, but this rant was prompted by a viral tweet about how people will advertise themselves as \"lgbtq+\" and then talk about \"the q slur\" or other issues with the word, and it just... Fuck, I've spent a long time being angry that the community tells me I'm not allowed to be uncomfortable with that word, but it really crosses another line when you explicitly mock people for accepting it as a self identity while also expressing their discomfort with the word.

In this case, though, the winners\nare not those who had a military or political victory but those who appear and\nlast on record.\nOne thing about the asexual community which is both helpful\nand detrimental is that the primary conversation is taking place outside of\nacademia; it is happening on the internet, here, with us. It\u2019s good because it\ngives people who aren\u2019t academics and who don\u2019t have the time, training, or\ninclination to write and then get published academic papers a voice in the\ndevelopment of the discourse surrounding the identity and the community. On the\nother hand, it means that there isn\u2019t a clear record of what the discourse is;\nconversations are having on different platforms in different spheres of the\ncommunity, and sometimes at cross-purposes to each other. \nWhat this means is that what will turn into our canon will\nbe based primarily on what discourses become popular and what discourses\nsurvive. Ideas that began in English-language posts are likely to end up being\nconsidered canonical to the community as a whole because that is (as far as I\nknow) where most of the discussions. Right now, conversations happening on\nTumblr and Wordpress seem to be what\u2019s being looked at; I honestly don\u2019t know\nif anything major is going on on AVEN right now because I think I\u2019ve looked at\nit maybe twice since I figured out if I was asexual. \nOddly, though, what the outside considers canon to the\ncommunity is more likely to come from AVEN, because that\u2019s where any news\narticle that mentions asexuality points to. So in that way, a canonical\ndiscourse is being set up for us that doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect that views of\nthe majority of the community.\nAs the community continues to develop online, there will\nlikely be more divides in ideas; depending on how it ends up going, different\ndiscourses and pieces of rhetoric may become common in the communities on\nTumblr and Wordpress simply because they may end up developing semi-isolated\nfrom each other. \nEventually, an accepted set of definitions and discourse is\nlikely to develop, and my concern is that that set is going to come from the\nloudest and most powerful voice at the time.\nWhat form will this set be in?\nProbably academic literature, which is where most \u201caccepted\u201d\nthought is. As bad as this may sound, people don\u2019t care what a bunch of people\nin their twenties* are saying on the internet. People in power\u2014politicians, the\nmedia\u2014like getting experts to talk about things**, and that means looking to\nacademics, because just because you experience something doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an\nexpert in it (and I\u2019m being semi-sarcastic here, because this is kind of true,\nbut it\u2019s also ridiculous that people would generally rather listen to someone\nwith a PhD than someone who lives it when it comes to making major decisions).\nAnd when people will study the community in the future (which will happen in\nthe future I imagine) they will do it through the lens of the academic\ndiscourse, which will be taken as the accepted discourse because it is all that\nmost people reading about us will ever read.\nAnd what does this mean for what our discourse will look\nlike?\nIt means that the final discourse will be shaped by those in\nthe community who have the wealth to go to college and pursue a PhD in queer\ntheory (or, to a lesser degree, literature). It means that the accepted\ndiscourse will be shaped disproportionately by people who are white, people who\nare wealthy, people who are American, people who are able-bodied and\nneurotypical. It means that the accepted discourse will be shaped in the same\nway that basically all discourse has been shaped in Western history, except\nours is probably more likely to have a higher proportion of women than typical\ndiscourse simply because there seem to be a higher proportion of women who\n(openly) identify as asexual than men***.\nAnd is there a way to stop this?\nI don\u2019t know. Honestly, I have no idea if there\u2019s another\nway this can go. Truth be told, I don\u2019t know if this is how it\u2019s going to go;\nit\u2019s just what I get from looking at history and projecting forward. But if\nthere is a way to try to fix it, we should work towards it. Because I don\u2019t\nknow about other people, but I don\u2019t want our accepted discourse to be shaped\nthe same way discourse has been, simply because that\u2019s the easiest way to go\nabout it.\n*From what I\u2019ve seen, many of the people active in the\ncommunity are in their twenties, which means that it\u2019s likely that the\ncommunity is likely to be viewed as being made up as people in their twenties,\nbecause people like simplifying things.\n**With the unfortunate exception of some things that really\nneed experts, like climate change.\n***Except, funny enough (and no disrespect to David Jay, he\u2019s\ndone a lot of good for the community), the public face of the community is a\nwhite man."}, {"blog_name": "angeloncewas", "id": 658919340583845888, "date": "2021-08-08 03:47:31 GMT", "timestamp": 1628394451, "tags": ["sorry am i allowed to be discoursey while still simping", "IM A MAN OF MANY TALENTS", "who am i today", "discourse", "mcyttwt critical"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZefCzTaaywOl8e00", "note_count": 18, "body": "I literally ascended for a good 20 minutes and I still feel inclined to make fun of whatever Twitter's on rn because I know for a fact that so many of them are superficial as fuck and shit on other ccs' looks lmao"}, {"blog_name": "ugh-fml", "id": 655751211244535808, "date": "2021-07-04 04:31:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1625373088, "tags": ["lesbian", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZHmEWbaPia2NGq00", "note_count": 63, "body": "Here are some of my opinions!!!

However, thanks to the pandemic and the extra free time and lack of financial stability it caused, that's true of pretty much every craft. Plus the people who make this argument know there are talented resin artists, and fall all over themselves trying to make exceptions for their favorite dice maker.\nThe environmental argument centers around the fact that resin is a type of plastic and thus not biodegradable. But most crafts involve use of plastic. Acrylic yarn is the cheapest and most widely available type of yarn, it's made of plastic. Acrylic paints are plastic. Polymer clay is plastic. Polyester fabrics are plastic. Most art supplies come wrapped in single use plastic and or are made of it. Plastic is literally inescapable in the modern world. Yes that's a huge problem, but it's not the fault of someone who sells resin dice on etsy. This isnt even going into how many of the suggested \"plastic free\" alternatives like pottery or glassblowing require large expensive equipment that use huge amounts of energy, usually from fossil fuels. \nThe only argument that I think really has any footing is safety. Many resin artists seem to be unaware of resin's toxicity, or they dont care. Because of this many work with it in unventilated living areas without PPE, and make items that arent fit for purpose. Uncured resin is toxic. Resin dust is toxic. Heat causes resin to break down. You need to protect yourself when you work with it and you SHOULD NOT be using it for kitchenware, body jewelry, grinders, or ashtrays. Period, end of story.\nHowever, safety is actually a huge issue in ALL crafts. I'm a fiber artist, just this week there was a huge discourse about the use of acrylic yarn for pot holders (its plastic, it melts when exposed to high heat, and can melt into the skin when used for its intended  purpose). People were genuinely upset at being told that acrylic is unsafe, and calling other fiber artists classist for pointing out that only cotton and wool are safe for heat. I saw a video from a potter, angry about their peers selling ceramic smoking supplies that arent properly glazed, or fired, putting their customers at risk. \nIt's not just resin.\nWe need to be educating people on safety and appropriate use across all crafts, not just crucifying the \"bad\" craft you dislike. Please think critically and actually do some research instead of just adopting the arguments and opinions of the first tiktok you vaguely agree with."}, {"blog_name": "kaztheghost", "id": 654531880561016832, "date": "2021-06-20 17:30:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1624210243, "tags": ["not surprising but damn", "mcc", "discourse", "negative", "sorry for the aggression", "but as a lesbian I\u2019m asking everyone shitting on Technoblade for being \u2018lesbophobic\u2019 to shut the fuck up", "how about actually listening to his lesbian fans instead of saying actual lesbophobic shit to us huh", "this Mcc does have a diversity problem but the way these people are acting shows they don\u2019t actually care about it and they just want", "dream smp members who havent been cancelled on there", "pov I hate Twitter", "Twitter drama"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZgY78YaLNKSB0W00", "note_count": 39, "body": "the fact that the people putting a fight against techno are the same people who said they wouldn\u2019t watch because the dream team wasn\u2019t in it is so fucking hypocritical people on Twitter are dumb as fuck wow"}, {"blog_name": "d-falt", "id": 165434285977, "date": "2017-09-17 12:39:14 GMT", "timestamp": 1505651954, "tags": ["truscum", "transgender", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZAIgsg2Q4fj_P", "note_count": 9, "body": "some people identify as trans, but usually choose not to or simply can\u2019t undergo surgery/transitioning because they\u2019re financially unstable, their body will react badly to it, or it simply just isn\u2019t for them, and in my opinion, i think we should respect that."}, {"blog_name": "iowasi", "id": 169019309774, "date": "2017-12-28 01:55:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1514426146, "tags": ["sorry", "discourse", "feelin stressed and upset for the past couple days so"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZGzPBj2TQLVxE", "note_count": 1, "body": "okay I think i\u2019m done mass posting discourse for today"}, {"blog_name": "jinm1n", "id": 173557931786, "date": "2018-05-03 22:37:48 GMT", "timestamp": 1525387068, "tags": ["discourse", "im looking up short hair tutorials and theyre all chicks w long hair", "stop"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZAmHKy2XeszyA", "note_count": 0, "body": "why do ppl w shoulder length hair call their hair short, it isn\u2019t that short?\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "classically-abby", "id": 673757541109514240, "date": "2022-01-18 22:34:22 GMT", "timestamp": 1642545262, "tags": ["classically abby vtuber project", "classically abby", "discourse", "antidrugs", "anti draco malfoy", "antiweed", "classicwoman"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZhjoDUbPgkdsai00", "note_count": 33, "body": "I log in to Tumblr, and all of these girls are posting, \u201cI hate being laced with the burden of consciousness\u201d, before going off to smoke weed. \nLike, yeah!

Stigma makes it harder for those suffering from the disorder to seek help or form support groups to cope with their disorder and continue their resolve not to act, which is why it\u2019s important to remember that this is a mental illness and those suffering need help, and should be supported in getting help. Because\u00a0\u2018pedophiles should all be killed\u2019 doesn\u2019t help an individual who has never hurt anyone, and doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone cope or keep an individual who does want to hurt someone from acting on their desire. As with other crime, if people feel they\u2019ll be hated no matter what they do, they\u2019re more likely to feel they have nothing to lose by committing the crime.\u00a0\nPlease: \nDo not contribute to the stigma against pedophilia itself, as a mental disorder, because that does not help protect children, whereas the availability of treatment could help prevent CSA before it happens.\u00a0\nMolester, Rapist\n - what we call the crimes committed by a sexual predator\u00a0\nIf you want a word to describe someone you feel preyed upon children, it\u2019s better to use the words rapist or molester. Rapists and molesters absolutely deserve stigma for their actions. Just words like sociopath and psychopath have been popularly used to mean \u2018serial killer\u2019 \u00a0or\u00a0\u2018dangerous\u2019, \u2018pedophile\u2019 has become short hand for \u2018child molester\u2019 or\u00a0\u2018rapist\u2019.\u00a0\n(I remember once saying I didn\u2019t want to walk alone at night, because there could be pedophiles around, to which my friend said, you\u2019re 20 so you\u2019re a bit old to have to worry about pedophiles, but in my mind pedophile meant rapist, meant creepy person out to hurt you).\nHowever, we shouldn\u2019t use words used to describe mental illness (sociopath and psychopath have been retired from usage as a diagnosis, with the condition now called ASPD or DPD) to describe criminal actions, even if some mental illness can cause the brain to be wired in ways that lead to urges that would be harmful if acted upon. Call a killer a killer, a rapist a rapist, a molester a molester.\nExample:\u00a0\u201cBlack Butler makes me uncomfortable, there\u2019s a lot of fan service involving a 12 year old with overtones of molestation.\u201d \u00a0\nIncorrect:\u00a0\u201cBlack Butler makes me uncomfortable, there\u2019s a lot of fan service involving a 12 year old, it\u2019s pedophilia\u201d \u00a0\nPlease:\n You should not call another person a rapist or a child molester unless they have committed rape or child molestation, as it takes away from the seriousness of the allegation. Those words should be reserved for people who have committed those acts or contributed to the serious harm of real people. Additionally, survivors of CSA often struggle with self blame and thus being told they are a\u00a0\u2018child molester\u2019 because of what they ship or support\u00a0\u2018child molesters\u2019 if they aren\u2019t against shipping is very hurtful.\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t want what happened to me. I didn\u2019t ask for it. I would never want anyone to go through that, and am so sorry for the friends I have who\u2019ve experienced similar trauma. Do not imply that I wanted it for myself or others, or that I am just as bad as my abuser.\u00a0\nChild Pornography\n - Video or photographic recording of child molestation or rape. Child pornography is illegal because in order to create it a child must be hurt and it provides economic incentive to hurt children. Many victims of child pornography are sold by their own parents, motivated by money.\u00a0\nAlthough the age of consent is 16 in most of the world, in general no one under 18 can be filmed or photographed for pornography as there is an issue of coercing minors into performing in such works for monetary gain.\nPlease:\n Do not call fictional stories or drawings\u00a0\u2018child pornography\u2019 as that word is reserved to describe a crime against real children who were really harmed. Words used to describe horrible things should be reserved for those things. Fictional depictions children or teens engaged in sex should be described as such.\nExample:\u00a0\nCorrect: \u201cOne year, as a prank, a bunch of cis het dude bros showed graphic shota porn at an anime con after taking over the time slot of a yaoi panel to make the female fans attending feel uncomfortable. The anime showed an underage character being molested and raped and left many attendees feeling disgusted and disturbed.\u201d\u00a0\nIncorrect:\u00a0\u201cOne year, as a prank, a bunch of cis het dude bros showed child pornography at an anime con after taking over the time slot of a yaoi panel to make the female fans attending feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u00a0\nAge of Consent\n - \u00a0The legal agent that a person can consent to engage in sexual activity. This varies by country (and state in the US), globally the average age of consent is 16, but age of consent maybe as low as 14 (as in Italy and Germany, to name a few places).\u00a0\nIn the US, the age of consent varies by state, with the a majority of states setting the age of consent at 16. However, a higher percentage of the US population resides in states where the age of consent is 18. For more see\n here\nEphebophilia \n- Is not a diagnosis and it\u2019s debated whether it exists. The word was coined to describe attractions to teenagers, particularly male attraction teenage boys. The word means\u00a0\"one arrived at puberty\" or \"a youth of eighteen\u201d, essentually a young adult 15 - 19 who look more pretty/androgynous.\nTeenagers as a whole don\u2019t have particular characteristics. There are adults who look like teens and teens who like adults, but younger men may look more feminine.\u00a0\n\u00a0Societies that encouraged relationships with teenagers, such as ancient Greek relationships between men and boys, did not actually distinguish by age. The\u00a0\u2018active partner\u2019 was whoever was considered\u00a0\u2018manly\u2019 and could be as young as 15, the\u00a0\u2018passive partner\u2019 could be as old as 24. What determined their role was whoever looked more feminine and the practice had less to do with Ancient Greek men having \u00a0an interest in teenage boys (ephebophilia) as the fact their society was misogynistic.\u00a0\nTrue romantic relationships did not exist between men and women, as women were not considered equal mentally, so men sought to fulfill romantic needs with other men, however, to be a\u00a0\u2018passive partner\u2019 was considered womanly, and thus shameful, so a would be wrong to treat another man\u00a0\u2018like a woman\u2019. They got around that by dividing men into\u00a0\u2018manly men\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018feminine men\u2019, where more feminine looking, usually younger (because growing a beard is manly) men could play the\u00a0\u2018submissive role\u2019 before graduating into the\u00a0\u2018manly role\u2019.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s isn\u2019t a phenomena where people are attracted to teenagers categorically, rather if a predator prefers teenagers it\u2019s because they\u2019re seen as easier targets since they have less experience (older teenagers, including teens over 18, are often the target of predators). Additionally, societies that value youth or virginity may encourage members to seek out younger partners. \u00a0\nIf someone who is older happens to like a younger teenager as a person, and not because they\u2019re younger, the attraction isn\u2019t unnatural, and if a relationships results it\u2019s not necessarily predatory or abusive. \nIt often \nis\n, as predators target younger victims, as such victims are vulnerable. That said, abuse is ultimately determined by whether \nabusive behavior\n\u00a0exists in the relationship. However, whether a relationship is healthy or abusive is a different question than whether the relationship is abusive is a separate question than whether or not the relationship is legal.

You have those species that are dime a dozen and\nhave little to no variation from one to the other. \u00a0In this particular\ncase, I am referring to the Xynthii,\u00a0Celestial Critters, Starrixy, and the\u00a0Zuboko.\n\n\n\nFirst of all before anything else: I am not\nridiculing any specific parson or directing this toward any one person in\nparticular. \u00a0Some of my issues may not apply to your design, some\nmay apply to all the designs. \u00a0I like the\noverall concept- hell, my monster girl Dalia (who was made before I had ever\nseen any of the afore mentioned species) has the cyclops eye mouth going\non! \u00a0However, there is a big reason why I\nfeel Dalia is set apart from the other circle-jerk knock off species (I will\nget into that reason last, though)\nThe first problem, and biggest\nproblem, I have with these 4 (and others not mentioned) species is that they\nare all so soooo blatantly ripped off from one another.\nThe eye is the most obvious of each: The teeth\nsurrounding an eyeball/pool of goop that come in different and disturbing\ncolors, making it look like weird cave or growth rather than an eye with\nteeth. \u00a0This is shared by most of these \u201cclosed\nspecies\u201d, which personally makes me thing that it\u2019s the only part that everyone\nreally wanted.\nThe clubbed feet??? \u00a0I don\u2019t know why, but from what I\u2019ve seen\nthey all have the mutated power puff girl feet.\nDrool from the eye/face hole. \u00a0All of these species have it either as an\noption or as a mandatory thing.\nHorns/animal ears too??? \u00a0Sometimes halos??? \u00a0I\u2019m guilty of the latter, but I don\u2019t get why\nthey all need the extra ancillary feature- oh wait, yes I do. \u00a0If they didn\u2019t have the extra horns or animal\nears, all of the species would look the same.\nAnother ancillary thing is the stomach/hand\nmouth. \u00a0Your species isn\u2019t \u2018original\u2019\nenough? \u00a0Slap an extra mouth on there,\nbecause the teeth surrounding your face hole are stolen so why not this too?\n\u00a0\nNow, to get to the real meat\nof my beef with these \u2018original species\u2019: They can\u2019t really be called different\nspecies any more. \u00a0If someone can look at\nyour species and say \u201cHey\u2019 that\u2019s one of those \u2013insert species here-\u201c when it\nis not, then there is an issue. \u00a0The\nexcessive creation of variations on these species has made them into more of a\ngenre of monster than anything you could call a \u2018closed species\u2019. \u00a0And it is partially the fault of the creators\nof the species themselves, tbh.\nYou look at most of these\nthings and they are \n1 Made on free-to-use bases\n2 from 30-50 dollars\n3 So basic that there is not\nreally a drive to buy them.\nWhen that happens, what do\npeople do? \u00a0Thy make their own! \u00a0But by calling them a closed species, they\nhave to put their own little twist on it so the creator cannot yell at them (A\nreal \u201coRiGiNaL cHaRaCtEr Do NoT sTeAl!!!!!!1!!!\u201d issue). \u00a0Then, when their own \u201coriginal species\u201d\nbecomes popular and they start selling adopts, the problem starts over again.\n\u00a0\nNow, in all fairness, it\u2019s\ntime to rip apart my girl Dalia. \u00a0When\ncreating her, I wanted to make a monster girl that represented my\naesthetics. \u00a0She is green, has blue hair,\nwears vinyl clothes in clashing colors, drools glitter slime, has a halo, and\nis over all just the cutest thing in the world to me! \u00a0However, she does share MANY traits of these\nsame \u201cclosed species\u201d (her mouth, while similar, is actually a cavity inside of\nher head with the teeth in her inner flesh. \nThe \u201ceyelid\u201d works as her second pair of lips! \u00a0The teeth are not on the outside like with\n75% of the ones mentioned above). \u00a0TBH I don\u2019t\nknow how it happened- maybe I saw one a long time ago and subconsciously copied\nit, maybe I was inspired by the same thing that inspired these people to create\ntheirs. \u00a0Who knows, but honestly, who\ncares??? \u00a0\nI do not have a problem with\nDalia being similar to other species. \nShe was, first of all, meant to be aesthetically pleasing and filled\nwith anime tropes. \u00a0I would have a\nproblem with Dalia if I were to start selling adoptable variations of her,\nhowever. \u00a0\nThis is why I feel that Dalia\nis not on the same rung as the other closed species:\nI do not count her as a species of her own (She\nis a one-off monster girl! \u00a0Nobody else\nin HER world is like her)\nI did not knowingly/purposefully/willingly take \u201cinspiration\u201d\nfrom any of the species mentioned above.\nI DO NOT sell adopts based off of her anatomy\nIn conclusion: I mean I\u2019m\nglad yall are making lots of money off of these things- selling adopts made on\na base or 50-75 dollars is incredible. \nJust, please don\u2019t pick fights with one another???"}, {"blog_name": "topazastral", "id": 654391179365007360, "date": "2021-06-19 04:14:20 GMT", "timestamp": 1624076060, "tags": ["topaz talks", "I really appreciate casual Judaism with characters", "but this!! not the way to do it!!!!!!!!", "just do like a little bit of research please", "discourse", "<- not really but for bl"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZgE4PXaKtKz_Cq00", "note_count": 1, "body": "I love Jewish Martin.

I\u2019m a firm believer that there\u2019s always at least one asshole in any group of a certain size, and I feel that\u2019s a fact we can all agree on. But let\u2019s talk about it in relation to suicide baiting and why the argument breaks down when it comes to antis.\nThere are some shitty pro-shippers out there. I don\u2019t agree with everyone in this branch of tumblr myself. Anti antis are a diverse bunch. Yeah, we\u2019ve got some shitty people in here. I\u2019ve even seen anti antis who actively harass people and suicide bait minors. It\u2019s shitty, and those people don\u2019t belong in the community. They\u2019re our bad apples. When antis try to claim that pro-shippers are constantly harassing them, we can accurately say that those actions were committed by a small, shitty few and the rest of us wish they would leave. The argument holds up, because the anti anti policy is block and report. Don\u2019t harass, don\u2019t suicide bait, block and report. The assholes are acting completely on their own initiative, against the general opinion of the community. And that makes them stand out as bad apples.\nThere are some shitty antis out there, but I don\u2019t call them bad apples. The premise of the anti movement is that people deserve to be called out and shamed for problematic behavior, that these \u2018pedophiles\u2019 and \u2018abusers\u2019 aren\u2019t people, they\u2019re monsters and should be treated as such. And this environment of dehumanization invites the use of harassment and suicide baiting as valid tactics. Antis may say that they don\u2019t suicide bait personally and that suicide baiters are just a few bad apples, but the movement is inherently about harassment. It is specifically meant to punish people through the Internet. And there\u2019s no rules in place to hold antis to a sense of morality when dealing with their targets. Suicide baiting is simply an extension of the basic premise, and that\u2019s why antis who do it can\u2019t be considered just bad apples. They are acting according to the will of the group."}, {"blog_name": "vampir3dean", "id": 176722366479, "date": "2018-08-07 04:49:39 GMT", "timestamp": 1533617379, "tags": ["JNDEJDBDJENEJJ", "damn its   annoying", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zog5Ne2abUL0F", "note_count": 0, "body": "self care is ignoring everyone on my feed because you\u2019re all just fighting each other for no reason when we\u2019re literally going to obtain the same content in the end. gn streaks\u270c\ufe0f\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "ranboober", "id": 658568905866067968, "date": "2021-08-04 06:57:31 GMT", "timestamp": 1628060251, "tags": ["imbasedasfuck", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zq2aGTaZjEu_Gy00", "note_count": 0, "body": "New username has been filtered.

With people complaining about him being a \"Scrooge\" during Christmas. Athiest or not, that's massively disrespectful, and I feel like writers might not have been aware of the long history of \"aw man look how bitter these Jews are, just wanting to ruin our Christmas fun, #waronchristmas\" Jews have. Or maybe they were aware, and thought changing the story beats just enough to be about redemption would make it ok? But the entire story was still a retelling of a Christmas Carol, with people bitching he wasn't in a Christmas spirit, even though, yeah, he was raised Jewish, obviously he doesn't subscribe to Christian traditions, Christmas included. He's still portrayed as the stingy Jewish stereotype, and the fun-ruiner. No one, not the Jewish character, or our educated protagonist, or the more culturally sensitive characters mention Hanukkah, or just not celebrating Christmas because he's not Christian. Like... Iines were changed and cut to fit the setting, but any mention of Jewishness of the character explicitly mentioned as being Jewish couldn't even be mentioned in passing? Y'all had to make the only Jewish character into an anti-Semitic protag to retell a Christmas Carol?\nLike I \nget it\n. As far as vaguely non-canonical stories with ambiguous time lines go, this was functional.

Or getting into the fact that an interracial same-sex couple is not the same thing as a white same-sex couple. And that for the past six years every E online couple that has won \nhas been white\n.

Feel free to skip over it.\nI will say that I am definitely frustrated with 2 things atm:\n1) Freeform\u2019s promo team (in general and for awhile now)\u00a0\n2) The way the episode was cut together.\u00a0\nThings I am not frustrated with:\nI am\n NOT\n frustrated with Matt and Harry or with Magnus and Alec \n(no, not even Alec, and Ill explain why).\n I think that they did a fantastic job in their scenes, and Harry and Matt were brilliant as ever. Harry slayed every single thing, and Matt was so good. Magnus was perfection the entire episode.\n\u00a0I know a lot of people think that Alec was acting out of character, but I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s true. I think that we just haven\u2019t see this side of him yet. This is new for Alec and new for us. Alec is going to get his footing and do the right thing guys. Its a new situation for him. And I \nFIRMLY\n believe that regardless of how the episode was cut, that \nALEC WOULD NEVER EVER HURT MAGNUS OR FORCE HIM TO DO ANYTHING\n and\u00a0\nMAGNUS BANE DOESNT TAKE SHIT FROM ANYONE\u2026..ESPECIALLY NOT ALEC.\n Sorry for the shouty caps, but I want to get this point across.\u00a0\nNow back to my frustrations:\n1) As for the promo team:\nThe promo team friggin sucks. They hyped the episode up as\u00a0\u201cMalec Mania\u201d and we got 3 minutes of Malec and what, like 5 minutes total of Magnus and/or Alec. They gave us stills or vids of most of it before hand, going so far as to spoil a big scene hours before the show aired.Then we got things leaked that weren\u2019t even in the episode. \u00a0I\u2019m probably going to have to stay off of social media this week, which sucks, because I like it here. But they want to leak all the Magnus and Alec stuff\u2026and 3 minutes of Malec would have been so much better and not left me feeling like we got short changed if I had not seen it already.\n2) As for the episode editing/writing:\n(And this is just the Malec stuff)\nWe should have gotten more time with Alec and Magnus talking and cuddling with their wine on that balcony and less time with Jace and a random naked girl. A minute\u202630 seconds\u2026something would have made a big difference and left us not feeling robbed.\nNow let me be clear:\n I was uncomfortable with the ending Malec scene. This whole time with all the promos I thought that Magnus would stop Alec because he thought Alec wasn\u2019t ready and was rushing because of his past. I thought the\u00a0\u201cvulnerable\u201d line would be about him showing Alec his cat eyes. But then Magnus essentially tells Alec that he\u2019s not on stable footing here. That he\u2019s feeling vulnerable and he isn\u2019t ready because he feels like he\u2019s going to lose Alec if they rush things. Magnus isn\u2019t ready. So when Alec says\u00a0\u201cI want this\u201d and keeps pushing Magnus back while unbottoning his shirt I did feel uncomfortable. I felt like they needed to stop and talk about it.\u00a0\nBut that being said\u2026\nwe haven\u2019t seen the end of that scene\n, and I hope for the love of everything in this world that we do get to see it. \u00a0But Magnus was kissing Alec back, and I think we all know that Magnus is strong enough to not be led to his bedroom, physically and emotionally if he doesn\u2019t want to. (Please do not think I am talking about EVERY person ever in this situation..I am talking about MAGNUS) So I repeat:\u00a0\nALEC WOULD NEVER EVER HURT MAGNUS OR FORCE HIM TO DO ANYTHING and \u00a0MAGNUS BANE DOESNT TAKE SHIT FROM ANYONE\u2026..ESPECIALLY NOT ALEC.\n Do I think the writers could have handled this better? Absolfuckinglutely! I understand leaving on a cliffhanger, but they needed just a little bit longer on that scene..some other sign from Magnus\u2026a head nod, or an ok, or even him pulling Alec closer. But the reason I think they didn\u2019t give us that was because of this:\nBased on the promo I think they are really NOT going to have sex, which is why they don\u2019t show Magnus giving verbal consent or more of the scene in general. They wanted to leave us on a cliffhanger to keep us wondering, and they will clear that up in the next episode. I believe Magnus will stop him and slow him down because he isn\u2019t ready. I hope we get to see that scene instead of them skipping over it and simply alluding to it. The writers and show runners have yet to screw up Malec, and so I am going to reserve judgement until I see the next episode, while admitting that they could have done a few things better here. Most of my frustration comes from the promo team and not the writers.\nNow, as for people tweeting the writers and them saying\u00a0\u201cyes, there absolutely was consent\u201d I do not think that is an admission that they had sex. I think they are saying there is consent in their relationship and there was consent for what was happening in the moment we saw. Not necessarily that Magnus consented to sex and it was off screen and we didn\u2019t get to see more of it. (And I dont need to see full on Malec sex, ok. I just want them treated like the straight couples on tv). I fully trust that they aren\u2019t going to do that to us. If I\u2019m wrong I\u2019ll be so pissed and just beside myself, because that would be super shady.\n\n\nI always welcome respectful discussion and opinions. You may not agree with me, and that's ok.  :) "}, {"blog_name": "snailsnfriends", "id": 664386554582745088, "date": "2021-10-07 12:06:33 GMT", "timestamp": 1633608393, "tags": ["discourse", "snailtrail.txt", "it's just a little silly is all"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zgx4tTauO0qZSq00", "note_count": 653, "body": "not to engage in disk horse or anything but the twitch income leaks and people's reaction to it reminds me of \"you will never eat the rich because you can't identify the rich. you will eat actors and doctors and the rich will laugh\""}, {"blog_name": "sapphicflash", "id": 171769353902, "date": "2018-03-11 20:12:24 GMT", "timestamp": 1520799144, "tags": ["rent", "discourse", "im not trying to shit on mar//ker", "i just think its bad to get rid of a woman", "especially a latina woman", "to ship two white boys", "please dont send me hate", "just dont interact if u dont like my opinion", "im not tagging it in the mar//ker tag cuz that would be bs", "mypost"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZjZJvg2V_G5Qk", "note_count": 1, "body": "controversial opinion\nwe should stop pushing mimi, a strong latina woman, out of the picture and story just so we can ship two white boys"}, {"blog_name": "zavala-swallows", "id": 668697502330109952, "date": "2021-11-24 02:07:13 GMT", "timestamp": 1637719633, "tags": ["gen talks", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zc9-2cb7iDNWay00", "note_count": 1, "body": "Bruh it's 2021 can we please stop acting like a collective gaggle of jackasses and stop shaming each other for shit like having acne?

I am not sure if I\u2019d call it whitewashing since we still have the original Symmetra skins (which all have her dark skinned apart from the Goddess-themed ones), and mostly because she still has like a purple-hue to her rather than just being straight up white (at least that\u2019s how I see it?).

Today's topic is Stylistics, in particular Speech and Thought representation.\n\n\nSpeech and thought representation\n is related to the point of view of a text, essentially who tells the story versus who listens. In stylistics this is called \nFocalisation\n: all this means is the perspective (both visual and emotional) from which the story is told. The narrator.\n\n\nSpeech and thought representation ties into this because the different categories of speech and thought put distance between the narrator and the character who is speaking/thinking. In order from closest to most distant, the categories are:\n\n\n-\nDirect Discourse\n: \nHe said, \"I agree.\"/ He thought, \"I should do it.\" \nThese two examples show direct thought/speech (we use \"discourse\" to mean both, there's no difference in categories between them). This is closest to the narrator, the use of reporting clauses (said, thought) \nand\n speech marks gives it weight, it's strong speech.\n\n\n-\nFree Direct Discourse\n: \nI agree / I should do it. \nThis is perhaps more difficult to demonstrate; Free direct discourse is the same as direct discourse, except either the reporting clause, the speech marks, or both are removed.\n\n\nBoth of these types of discourse are closest to the narrator, they are more engaged in telling the story and are essentially \nperforming\n rather than simply telling a story.\n\n\n-\nIndirect Discourse\n: \nHe agreed / he thought he should do it. \nThe pronoun here changes from \"I\" to \"he\" and the tense goes from present to past. While we're still saying the same thing as we did in direct discourse, we're more distant, we're relating the story rather than showing it.\n\n\n-\nFree Indirect Discourse\n: \nHe was in agreement / He should do it. \nWe've gone from actual speech to action now. No longer are thought or speech involved; the narrator's place within the story is removed, or the thoughts or speech of this character are irrelevant or weak.\n\n\n-\nNarrative Report of Discourse\n: \nHe agreed / He decided. \nThis is the weakest discourse. There is no reported speech or thought, these are just actions performed by the character now. We have gone from performing the story to the least engagement, \ntelling\n the story.

If I ever ran into a pedophile (or any other rapist) \nface-to-face then my ass would be going to jail because I would \ndestroy them\n.\n2)\n I understand that artists are not always good at being able to convey \nage in their art. Part of that is for a bunch of people age is really \nhard to pin down. Can some artists do better? Sure. I won\u2019t deny that. \nIt\u2019s on them to do what they can to make sure that it\u2019s obvious that \nBart and Jaime are shown old enough. Likewise it\u2019s on us authors to make\n it \ndamned\n clear that they are older and we\u2019re not sexualizing \nthem when they are way too damned young. Anyone who sexualizes them when\n Bart is \n13\n is in the wrong and is fucking gross.\n3) \nNot every three-year age gap is inherently toxic. Not even every larger \nage gap is inherently toxic. If it was, then no one should be shipping \nChalant, BirdFlash, Supermartian (Supermartian in particular since they \nhave a 45-year age gap), etc. If we want to get into real life \ntechnicalities, my older sister got married to her husband when she was \n17 and he was 25. They\u2019re still happily married and she has to be \ncareful about \nhis\n triggers because he\u2019s an abuse survivor (she\u2019s an abuse survivor too, but she\u2019s more snarly than he is).\n4)\n Just because most bluepulse shippers place Bart as forming a crush on \nJaime when he\u2019s 13 (with Jaime the usual trend is to have him take way \nlonger to start feeling that way toward Bart), that doesn\u2019t mean we want\n them in a relationship then. \nWe do not want them having a sexual relationship when Bart is that young because that is absolutely disgusting and wrong. \nFurthermore,\n it would be entirely out of character for Jaime to start creeping on \nBart. If anything it would be far more in character for Jaime to put off\n getting into any sort of relationship with Bart until they were both in\n their 20s, and even then Bart would probably still be the one to make \nthe first move.\n5) I am not in any way saying that anyone\u2019s \ntrauma is invalid or that anyone\u2019s triggers are invalid, because they\u2019re\n not. I get how absolutely awful trauma and triggers can be, and people \nwho are triggered by the ship absolutely have the right to not like it \nand want to avoid that. However, everyone has to understand that the \nmeaning associated with their individual triggers is not the same \nmeaning everyone else has for those things. You can not reasonably \ndemand that everyone should understand something through the same lens \nof trauma that you do. That would be like me expecting people to have \nthe same reaction to my own traumas as I do.\nTo anyone who feels \ntriggered or re-traumatized by the ship, I am genuinely sorry and you \nshouldn\u2019t have to go through that. I don\u2019t want to place the onus on you\n for being responsible for what happened to you (and I absolutely won\u2019t \nbecause I don\u2019t excuse that rape-apology bullshit), but at some point \nyou do have to be responsible for your own content consumption.

Your celebration of a riot, scrubbed of all deviancy for the eyes of your oppressor\nAnd expectations for pride is really reflecting the idea that queer events must all be rated E for Everyone. Putting aside how kink is not inherently sexual, even if the display is sexual in nature, it's not like pride, or even daily life is devoid of sexuality. People wear sexy clothes all the time, for the explicit purpose of being sexy. Some straight people straight up celebrate having babies, a result of sexual intercourse, every fucking where (\"I'm pregnant\" shirts, social media, family gatherings, they will not shut up). \nBut it's okay cause these are not deviant and creepy, unlike the leather outfits and the collars at Pride.

They're not having sex, but I relate the sight of kink gear to sex, so it's the same as public fornication\nThere should be plenty of child-friendly lgbt+ activities, but Pride, where the deviants all crawl out of their decrepit isolation chamber to celebrate gender, love and \nSEXUALITY\n is not one of them\nAlso, even without kink, pride is plenty sexual with people making out, shirts and candies that are genital shaped.

It was not my intention at\nall to offend you in any way, and now reading over what I had written, I\nrealized that some of it sounded very harsh. I apologize for this and hope that\nyou can forgive me.\nWith that said: Race of a character is not something that\ncan be decided differently by every single person, unless that character's race\nis unspecified. Characters like Hermione Granger, who is never explicitly given\na race, are okay to draw as white or black or Asian or anything because it's\nopen to interpretation. Canon race is not open to interpretation, meaning that\nyou cannot ignore or change their race, just like you cannot ignore or change\naspects of that character's personality. True, none of the Voltron paladins are\nexplicitly given a specified race, but we know that they are not canonically\nwhite. Shiro's full name, Takashi Shirogane, is Japanese, implying that he is\nat least of Japanese descent. That is canon. However, we don't know whether\nhe's full Japanese or half or whatever; this is where it's open to\ninterpretation. You can Headcanon him as half-Japanese half-Brazilian as I've\nseen some do, or even half-Japanese half-white, but you cannot take away his\nJapanese heritage.\nI will admit that the races of the Voltron characters are,\nas of now, mostly headcanons instead of fact. Lance is believed to be Cuban\nbased off of a line where he mentions missing a specific beach in Cuba, Hunk is\nbelieved to be Hawaiian or Polynesian based on his skin tone, and Keith is believed to be Korean as his voice actor is Korean.\u00a0But the fact that we don't know what specific race or\nethnicity they are doesn't change the fact that they aren't white. Since they\nare not white, they should not be drawn as white, simple as that.\nAlso, I don't think you can completely compare age to race,\nas age is something that changes. Race does not change.\nEdit: Thanks to \n@shinyivyleaves\n for clarifying that Kogane is a Japanese name, and that Keith is headcannoned as Korean because his voice actor is Korean"}, {"blog_name": "wolfpainters", "id": 171757250134, "date": "2018-03-11 12:38:17 GMT", "timestamp": 1520771897, "tags": ["discourse", "sorry guys", "but i just need to say this at the very least", "the shit people has been dealing with for so long is so gross and terrible", "and it needs to stop"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZBgb5u2VzXwPM", "note_count": 1960, "body": "I am extremely embarrassed and ashamed of those in the fandom who has been harrassing anyone because of fictional characters.

Like they see us as children who are playing pretend instead of real people. \nTrans men don\u2019t identify as a man, they are men. \nI don\u2019t identify as nonbinary, I am nonbinary. \nAnd it\u2019s not just for gender btw \nI don\u2019t identify as a lesbian, I am a lesbian. \nThey never say straight people identify as straight and they never say cis people identify as cis. That word is reserved for queer people to assert that we may think these things about ourselves but they\u2019re not really true.\nIdk I\u2019ve just been thinking about this a lot lately like :/ like how come Josh is a straight man but I identify as a nonbinary lesbian?

It\u2018s a lot to unpack and for the first time I feel some slight trepidation about where exactly they are going with all the themes they have set up so far.\nI\u2019m going to tag this as discourse so nobody who just wants to enjoy this show and have fun with it gets annoyed. I get that. Because so far I\u2019ve been loving it, too. For the most part.\nAnd even if my fears turn out to be justified I\u2019m still going to enjoy all the awesome fanfic (and possibly fix-its) that come out of this.\u00a0\nWarning: spoilers ahead for episode 3 - Power Broker\n.\n So let\u2019s start with the good stuff of which this episode had plenty. \nPhenomenal acting from Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan and Daniel Br\u00fchl (one of my favorite German actors and I\u2019m always happy to see him showcase his considerable talent). His Zemo is both threatening and charismatic. You cannot help but listen to Zemo\u2019s point of view because a lot of it actually makes sense but it is also very clear that he has ulterior motives and is following his own agenda all the way through.\nIt\u2019s great to see Sharon as a character in her own right and not just a romance option for one of the main characters. I hope she gets more time to shine.\nThe production values and cinematography are mind-blowingly good. The whole section in Madripoor was an absolute thrillride and I could watch Stan and Mackie as these characters and their dynamic for hours on end and never get tired of it.\nSo all of that was really good and yet I feel slightly uneasy after watching and I\u2018m questioning whether the direction I thought they were heading in is ultimately the one they are actually taking this.\nFirst of I am a big fan of Steve Rogers as Captain America. Much more than I ever expected to be of a character with that moniker. Because initially when I heard that the MCU would introduce him in the movies I expected hurrah patriotic jingoistic bullshit. But what they ultimately did with him never felt like that. \nSteve wasn\u2018t fighting to kill. He wasn\u2018t fighting because everyone opposing his country must clearly be the bad guys. He fought to protect because he himself knew what it meant to be powerless. And he was wary of shadowy organisations be they foreign or domestic who employed questionable tactics and excused them as the ends justifying the means. \nBecause the ends rarely justify the means. And doing wrong for the greater good doesn\u2019t make it right. \nSo I got to ask what the hell Bucky is on about with the shield. Steve dropped it twice because saving his friend (in both instances Bucky) was more important than the shield and whatever it stood for. It\u2018s like Bucky never understood who Steve became after they separated. But I guess that fits because I also think Steve never saw that Bucky wasn\u2018t exactly the same person that he lost in the war.\nWhich brings me to The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Bucky\u2018s and Sam\u2018s reckless decision making in episode 3.\nSpoilers for the whole episode ahead so please don\u2018t continue if you haven\u2018t watched it yet.\nSo in episode 3 as I said we get a lot of reckless decision making and pretty much everyone commits acts that are morally problematic and sometimes outright reprehensible.\nKarli kills. Not out of self defence but because she feels jusitfied in employing violence against those that have wronged her and the downtrodden the Flagsmashers claim to be trying to help.\nCaptain Walker shows exactly why he isn\u2018t the right person for the job when he is goaded into lashing out by the German (\nnot really German\n) guy that helped Karli and her friends.\nAnd I\u2018m sure we are meant to question this and see the problems. See the parallels between the two.\nWhat I\u2018m not so sure about is whether the show is self aware enough to realize that Bucky\u2019s and Sam\u2018s actions here are in no way better. They are doing the same shit and I can\u2019t simply overlook that just because they are the titular heroes.\nSo this is the kind of shit Bucky and Sam get up to in this episode:\nThey free Zemo and are hence directly responsible for every person that is harmed or killed as a result.\nThey are accessories to murder in at least two instances. Doesn\u2018t matter who pulled the trigger. Both people wouldn\u2018t be dead if they hadn\u2018t done what they did up until that point.\nThey employ excessive force against their enemies. The fights are very stilized and choreographed incredibly well. You can feel (and hear) every bone cracking. It\u2019s like watching a John Wick movie. But (at least to me) for a show so grounded in realism and which has been tackling difficult subjects as we\u2019ve seen so far, that\u2019s actually a problem. An instance of wanting to have your cake and eat it too. Because reveling in this violence to the extent the show does here definitely feels a little off. \nAll of that leaves me with a big question and I\u2018m a little afraid of what the answer might be. Because honestly I\u2018m on the side of Karli in thinking that the world would be a better place without borders. That the idea that people are inherently bad or good because they happen to have been born in a different country is ludicrous. That nationalism is actually a problem and that blind patriotism should at least be questioned and ideally abandoned.\nI\u2018m not sure though that this is the answer the show will give me. And if someone (Bucky or Sam) at some point picks up that stupid shield and spouts some nonsense about patriotism and doing it for America I\u2018m going to be severely disappointed.\nAt which point I\u2018m going to still applaud the show for what it did right (like addressing institutionalized racism, giving us complex and interesting characers and some pretty fantastic Sambucky interactions) but I might not be so eager to watch it again.\nThen again knowing that this is a show about superheroes produced by Disney, funded/supported at least in part by the US military and being first and foremost an American cultural product with everything that entails, I probably shouldn\u2018t get my hopes up and just try to enjoy the ride regardless.\nI guess we\u2018ll just have to wait and see...."}, {"blog_name": "kitainari", "id": 175859885842, "date": "2018-07-13 21:42:57 GMT", "timestamp": 1531518177, "tags": ["discourse", "anime", "kink ment", "animation in anime is honestly the smoothest ive ever seen", "and modern anime art styles are such a good blend between stylized cartoon and realistic", "yall are just cranky"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZgmXHZ2Zo4ESI", "note_count": 0, "body": "i will not rest until people stop seeing anime as \"weird kinky japanese shit\" full of underage panty shots and alien proportions, and instead realize that 1) western cartoons have just as much, if not more, weird fanservice and obscure kink tie-ins, and 2) anime is a MEDIUM, not a GENRE, and most anime is gorgeous, story-driven, and made with love and care and hard work. dont let the kinky minority distract from the rest, and absolutely dont blame problems with certain series on japanese culture. go watch a real anime for once and stop judging the whole of the medium from the surface\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "comfy-profic-space", "id": 650659346969149440, "date": "2021-05-08 23:38:27 GMT", "timestamp": 1620517107, "tags": ["discourse", "this is pathetic"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZvP74Va7cpgDua00", "note_count": 2, "body": "Anons are really angry tonight, it seems."}, {"blog_name": "dyketubbo", "id": 664723089422204928, "date": "2021-10-11 05:15:37 GMT", "timestamp": 1633929337, "tags": ["long post", "negative", "discourse", "antisemitism tw", "like normally i talk a lot about not getting pissed about stuff online but that genuinely made me want to stab someone", "literally if you find yourself having those kinds of thoughts?", "dont entertain it.", "youll sound like a fucking dumbass.", "dont be a dumbass.", "mask mews", "fandom critical"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z46cLTavaY330i00", "note_count": 19, "body": "nevermind the \"knifetrick's blood libel esque plot\" shit managed to cross my dash time to get pissed.\nif you use minority groups' suffering to fucking vague some goddamn fanfiction about two ocs, i fucking hate you with my entire being. dont just throw around words like goddamn \nBLOOD LIBEL, WHICH IS AN ANTISEMITIC ALLEGATION ABOUT JEWISH PEOPLE MURDERING CHRISTIAN CHILDREN\n so you can shit on a fanfiction that has Nothing, and i mean Noth.

So. What do? I guess, like I said in my tags earlier, it probably matters more what they\u2019re doing behind the scenes to support women - especially women who\u2019ve been raped or harassed and need support as they tell their stories and confront their abusers. And that might not be publicized. (So for that reason, I\u2019m going to try to be less quick to brush off all public displays of solidarity because we don\u2019t know that some of them aren\u2019t also supporting women in other, more tangible ways. Idk!)\nAlso, personally I keep learning about a new case of abuse/sexual harassment/rape like... every day, and I wonder how the news of it travels among members of the industry (actors, directors, etc.), and if there are even cases that some celebs know and others just don\u2019t yet??? At least until it hits the news. But even then, if I don\u2019t know about it, can I expect them to? Maybe! I don\u2019t know! Anyway, I think what matters more is that Actor X or Director Y stops working with Abuser as soon as (contractually/legally?) possible after they find out Abuser has been abusing. But if they don\u2019t know? Is there any room for plausible deniability? Or is it just no excuse?

In fact based on the first movie alone (and ignoring the student/teacher implications) I was far more inclined towards spuhura than spirk in AOS.\nThe reason I dislike Uhura, I have realised, is because she reminds me of my ex.\nBecause in the first movie she was caring and considerate of what Spock was going through and the way in which he processed things and how it was different to how she would. But then in Into Darkness, when he processes something different to how she would have, she gives him the cold shoulder. Waits until he can't escape to confront him. And confronts him in front of someone else so that he can't respond the way he might if they were alone. And after that, she just goes back to how it was. Considerate and kind.\nThis is exactly what my ex did to me, he started off considerate of my differences to him, but gradually he stopped. Until any time I did something he didn't like, I would have to defend myself and beg forgiveness, usually in front of others. Because (as he said) he was the only one who could or would care for me.\nSo no. I don't like Spuhura. And I don't like AOS Uhura. Y\u2019all are free to like her as much as you want.

Then he does it again a few more times.\nSome people like it, because it takes something and puts it into a more accessible format. And he tries - kind of - to source properly when he\u2019s going over existing analysis and meta.\nAnyway, he made a video on the Reylo ship and the history of it. Watch it \nhere\n.\nSome people simply took it as a cool thing - Reylo hitting more\u00a0\u2018mainstream\u2019 avenues, etc. etc.- others took it as irksome because of his initial attitude, incorrect sourcing and sexist premise.\nI think people have expressed a similar reaction to mine already so please read their words \nhere\n, \nhere\n,\u00a0\nhere\n, and \nhere\n.\nI don\u2019t really want to rehash why the video\u2019s tone was annoying and off-putting to those of us who have contributed so much to the fandom - it\u2019s not about gatekeeping, it\u2019s about respect - and it\u2019s well within my rights - \nour \nrights - to demand it. Especially in a fandom or sphere that can be\u00a0incredibly sexist - even subconsciously.\nIf we don\u2019t point it out, and push back, how will it ever get any better?\nI remember a discussion I had after the S4 Sherlock premiere - when I was still excited about it being out, and I was talking to \n@ohtze\n about it and she said something about\u00a0\u2018yeah I heard what they did\u2019. And I didn\u2019t know that they had done anything bad - aside from killing Mary - so I was like\u00a0\u2018are people really upset about that? it\u2019s in the books, not all that surprising...\u2019\nThen she mentioned that they\u00a0\u2018fridged the mother\u2019 - I had never ever heard that term before, would never have recognized the tactic without it being pointed out. She explained the issue - (forgive me Ohtze if I oversimplify it again!) basically when authors kill off women after they\u2019ve\u00a0\u2018served their purpose\u2019 - ie, after they have a child, etc. So she was - theoretically - brought on to have John\u2019s child, then killed - so that way they can raise a child together without women, etc. etc.\nNow I didn\u2019t really see at first why this was an issue - because I knew that she served more than one purpose, but then after some debate and back and forth - with Ohtze saying more than once that it doesn\u2019t matter if it was completely intentional, it\u2019s about the optics and how writers need to be more aware of these things as they write, etc. etc. - I finally stopped being defensive and realized that she was right.\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t matter so much if it was on purpose or not - the effect is still the same. And then I realized that it is exactly what happened to Padme and why I\u2019m still so angry over it - even renewed in my anger.\nMy point isn\u2019t to get into a discussion about fridging mothers, or whatever, it\u2019s about the importance of \nhaving arguments.\u00a0\nI think that even though a lot of us naturally feel defensive about certain things, in fandom and out, that it should be OK to have discussions and yes even arguments without cutting people out because of their reactions. I still have issues there - but I\u2019ve seen more than once how valuable it can be to have someone push back on your opinions.\nI feel this way about the Vincent video - whatever my personal issues are with the way he goes about making these videos, the fact of the matter is that his tone and stance is indicative of fandom culture and sexism. Women like to \nship \nthings, nevermind the fact that we have spent almost two years debating this and analyzing source materials, it\u2019s definitely because we just like the way they look together.\nAnd you know what? Even if we \ndid \njust ship them because of looks - who cares? Who are these people to tell us that\u2019s less valuable than liking the Snoke as Plagueis theory?\nSo yeah, I think we should offer constructive criticism on the piece AND acknowledge that it is completely OK that it has opened once more the broader discussion on conscious and subconscious sexism in fandom culture - among other things.\nIt doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re gatekeeping or being unreasonable, it just means that we may be pointing out things that not everyone sees - like fridging - and that once we get past defensiveness, maybe fandom culture can improve just that much more.\nMaybe all the backlash and criticism of his video will make him think about his approach next time - maybe not, but it doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t point it out next time."}, {"blog_name": "hughthehand", "id": 150090832733, "date": "2016-09-07 21:20:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1473283258, "tags": ["hale.docx", "txt", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZhA0en2Bo75jT", "note_count": 6, "body": "friendly reminder:\nd*ke is a slur targeted at lesbians and only lesbians can reclaim it\nbutch/femme are also lesbian terms that you should probably stay away from if you\u2019re not a lesbian"}, {"blog_name": "beekeepercain", "id": 161917715958, "date": "2017-06-17 05:24:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1497677068, "tags": ["replies", "always-keep-writing", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZL0PFu2Mp34Ns", "note_count": 2, "body": "always-keep-writing\n\u00a0replied to your post:\u201calways-keep-writing replied to your post\u201calways-keep-writing replied...\u201d\ni see your point but consider: sam is bi\nwrong"}, {"blog_name": "devilmeadow", "id": 151511618628, "date": "2016-10-08 12:08:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1475928521, "tags": ["ace discourse", "im living for the discourse lately", "lgbt discourse", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z3b1Vr2D6ozH4", "note_count": 226, "body": "of course aroaces aren't straight,\nbut they sure as fuck aren't queer either"}, {"blog_name": "dumbassstupidblog", "id": 664712246637805568, "date": "2021-10-11 02:23:17 GMT", "timestamp": 1633918997, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z1fl5WavY4Gwii00", "note_count": 1, "body": "Kinda worried that the person I got into an argument with's followers are going to try to mess with my account or something :/\nDon't go bother them first /gen, they haven't done anything yet, I'm just being anxious about nothing."}, {"blog_name": "quackityinc", "id": 660338212768808960, "date": "2021-08-23 19:39:53 GMT", "timestamp": 1629747593, "tags": ["lore drought", "it's really not that big of a deal", "but people like that annoy me so soo much", "no you just don't care about smaller streamers", "discourse", "liveblog"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z6OEETaf-XiRiu00", "note_count": 4, "body": "did people...not know the egg was immune..."}, {"blog_name": "zurizaldun", "id": 163271211091, "date": "2017-07-22 01:19:13 GMT", "timestamp": 1500686353, "tags": ["libertarians", "politics", "American politics", "discourse", "Tyranny", "mumblings"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7HBMt2O3kFXJ", "note_count": 8, "body": "Libertarians are just advocates for tyranny by corporations/bosses"}, {"blog_name": "good-legs-lance", "id": 177072278813, "date": "2018-08-16 22:13:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1534457608, "tags": ["rant-ish", "discourse", "i guess", "kinkade"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZwyOih2awL8qT", "note_count": 6, "body": "everyone saying making kinkade a silent strong dude is racist but lmao i dont see it? this is coming from someone who is half-black too so dont come hissing at me.\nliterally just because he\u2019s silent and just happens to be black doesn\u2019t mean its racist, its literally just part of his personality.\u00a0\nin fact my personality is pretty much the same as his so like,,, i dont take any offense"}, {"blog_name": "sysburs", "id": 675196301958332416, "date": "2022-02-03 19:42:51 GMT", "timestamp": 1643917371, "tags": ["gay", "lgbtq", "endos dni", "discourse", "mspec gay", "mspec lesbian", "exclus", "anti inclus", "inclus dni", "transmed", "pro transmed", "sysmed"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z4UMHSbUntMJua00", "note_count": 40, "body": "this may be spicy, but gay men are men that love men and lesbians are women who love women."}, {"blog_name": "magiclamd", "id": 648760049894932480, "date": "2021-04-18 00:29:57 GMT", "timestamp": 1618705797, "tags": ["art", "discourse", "books", "writing"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZzkeWsa0szF_Sy00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Sometimes when I see people on social media screaming at each other over shipping or whether or not some piece of media is \u201cproblematic\u201d, I wonder if anyone is stopping to think about the function of art.

There will always be cause for error or an anomaly in any generalization, thats why it's a generalization (a majority of people fit \"x\" description, statistic, etc... when discussing \"x\" topic). We shouldn't look for an absolute in generality; it's impossible. Addressing specificity doesn't lead to the erasure of a problem upon a larger community, nor does it mislabel or improperly define communal issues if its appropriately/logically handled. If I talk about misogyny in the black community as opposed to the world, that doesn't mean it's not a global issue; I'm just discussing it on a smaller scale. Also, a more personable effect can be achieved this way, that may not have been able to engender a needed empathy or resignation from a certain group if \"x\" issue was discussed on a broader scale or by someone of the outside community, because it might not cater to or tackle individual needs and subsequent issues per community. That's why it's so important to properly understand the necessity for both [specificity/generality] when discussing most social issues. Society is too large and too complex to only address an issue from any one facet. I say all this to ask conventionally attractive gay men, as do all, to stop spreading this disseminating bull shit (and blatant lie) that just because they've never been or presumably haven't recognized that they perpetuate or benefit from toxic behavior and ideals in the (male) gay community (overbearing and self harming beauty standards, trade/DL culture, straight passing, misogyny, transmisogyny, homophobia, racism, etc) that they don't exist or are completely taboo for conversation because you're the one \"good\" minority whose friends don't openly address you with racist epithets (if that), or that being masculine enough justifies your disrespect for femininity and or women, it doesn't validate your apathy and hatred of transpeople, nor does it absolve you from your accountability in furthering the downfall of a community built on solidarity and tolerance. Personally I'm working on being more active in my community and creating better relationships, but I still have a lot to learn and do. I know I benefit from patriarchal and (African) American standards of men that debase femininity and the authenticity of many other gay men from visual appearance alone (before mannerisms and voice).

people, including people who have committed the most atrocious crimes in their eyes, rather than seeing the worst in people. it means accepting that even people who have done the worst possible crime in their eyes without remorse deserve the best possible environment to thrive in and exist harmoniously, and that\u2019s just an idea too radical for most people to accept, which is why prison abolitionism remains a hotly contested idea, even tho it\u2019s a well known fact that prisons are objectively terrible for society. cause fact is, prisons are not just a terrible environment for rehabilitation, they actively make people worse, and often times pull people into gangs. even if someone makes it through their sentence maintaining their best self, they\u2019ve been put away from society for so long that reentering society is often a challenging process, especially when they bear a criminal record that will make both individuals and businesses hesitant to accept them. that, combined with the fact that a lot of people are in prison for things that aren\u2019t even bad, means prisons are only actively making society a more dangerous place, rather than a safer one "},

chats so many dsmp members have. HOWEVER, i do think it\u2019s kinda stereotyping to assume that joining the dsmp automatically gets you a bad audience. there are people on the dsmp (punz and tubbo are prime examples again) who have chill chats that could blend in with most other chats on the platform. at the same time, a lot of times it takes extra effort from the streamer to make a chat act a way that is best suited for them. and honestly, i don\u2019t blame sneeg for not wanting to do that, even if i feel that he is exaggerating and being kind of a dick about it. \ntldr; the way that streamers interact with their chat is a big part of their job and i don\u2019t blame sneeg for what he said, even if he was a dick about it "}, {"blog_name": "transamity", "id": 180728055648, "date": "2018-12-02 20:24:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1543782281, "tags": ["discourse", "anyway down with cis lmfao"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZRPJ1k2eKEqTW", "note_count": 18, "body": "Anyway there is literally no harm in saying \u201ccis people suck lol\u201d bc y\u2019all will forever and always have far more political power over us.

They were very vocal about not wanting to ban gay marriage when that was proposed once in my state. They also punished me when I came out as bisexual by isolating me from my friends and psychologically tormenting me for years with interrogations about my orientation and that of the friends I attempted to have later, making me afraid to have close friendships in real life. They forcibly found out I was trans by searching my phone and I forgot to delete a couple of things one time, which I was trying to avoid that while I was living with them after coming out as bisexual. The abuse worsened.\nMy parents believe you should love everyone and treat people with respect, to uphold progressive love of equality. Oh but they also openly mock the poor and laugh at working class republicans for not wanting government programs. And will make fun of them outright or tell me to avoid those kinds of people because they might want to kill me. Barbaric claims about hardworking people.\nMy parents believe you should be able to defend yourself and your home, to work hard to sustain the things you create and help the people you love.

You are going to be guilty of cruel acts regardless (insulting the character of republicans all across the board)\n\u201cProgressive\u201d opinions don\u2019t make you a good person.

Having someone put their faith and possibly go out of their way for you is amazing. Keith probably realizes this and is trying to put his feelings in a rational way. Especially since he can put distance between him and people, yet when a bond is formed, it\u2019s intense.  \n\u201cYeah this guy is gorgeous and so amazing, but maybe it\u2019s just a dumb crush. He maybe be helping me out, but it doesn\u2019t mean there is anything there. He is like 24! I\u2019m 17! I think he amazing. I\u2019ll will always be thankful for Shiro for guiding me and I\u2019ll dedicate myself for him. Whether or not, he reciprocates my feelings.\u201d\nAs a saving grace and mentor to Keith, Shiro\u2019s relationship in a gray area for him. Shiro isn\u2019t family, yet he treats him with respect and kindness that is normal in that dynamic. He is a mentor, and the respect in each other\u2019s abilities early on can quickly grow into equal colleagues. \nKeith being connected with Shiro in bond and fate.\nThen having that person taken away is gut reaching. Keith is sick and tired of being left alone whether being abandoned, or life taking people away from him. That bond formed is so strong in Keith that even light years away, he feels it. Fate connecting the paladins together only intensifies the bond.\nKeith functioned better as a supporting role. His growth into a leader isn\u2019t easy.\nHe also has no problem with leadership, it\u2019s when it\u2019s abused that he can not stand. Shiro earned his trust. Allura might have been rough on getting the paladins ready for their role, but the fact that it did help got Keith to trust her in her  leadership role.\nHis first role as a paladin leader was going head first into battle with hardly any communication between himself and his team. It\u2019s even more frustrating because it isn\u2019t even a new team. The stress of replacing Shiro as the Black paladin which was in a way accepting the fact Keith needs to move forward. It was a lot for him to deal which did effect him negatively. I can\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t have experience in leadership because he been under Shiro\u2019s guidance for so long, Keith should have picked up some traits of a good leader.  The Keith we saw grieving Shiro\u2019s loss was probably a close indicator of a pre-shiro Keith. Lack of communication, tunnel vision and jumping into the situation without a plan. \nKeith does eventually grow into his leadership role, but his growth is cut short too soon at the return of Shiro. Taking command and supporting the leader are his new  struggles when Shiro recovers. Even Shiro, despiste his own wishes of wanting Keith to lead, leads from the castle. \nThe Blade of Mamora is the in-between for Keith\nThe Blade of Mamora appeals to his old and new ways. The entire guild has a mission but it\u2019s enacted alone. The end of the galra empire but by any means necessary. It\u2019s him reverting to old habits, but taking what he learned from Voltron in mind.  \nLike he devoured himself to Shiro then Voltron. It gave him a greater self of purpose and helped him form a new identity. Then comes in the the fact he  is part galra and has a connection the BOM. This provides a viable way to connect to his new heritage and mom. No way in hell would Keith have gotten anything from the galra empire.  \nShiro has a feeling Keith\u2019s feelings have some romantic inclination\nShiro maybe had an idea that Keith likes him romantically. He is thankful that Keith has grown under his guidance and even gained a comrade. This relationship isn\u2019t one sided in growth. Shiro also learned to a better understanding of team dynamic. How to encourage strength in others. This bond is unbreakable. Shiro also knows that Keith isn\u2019t vocal on how he feels, but his actions speak volumes. He never intended for Keith to get so attached and for the connection to turn romantically. He doesnt have those feelings for Keith. He is young. Still stunted emotionally sometimes. So inexperienced. Maybe sees some of himself in Keith.\nHe helped Keith out of empathy maybe. I like the idea that younger Shiro had his own rebellious streak. Not the same as Keith, but it causes trouble for himself none the less. He saw Keith and could relate painfully. \nSummary\nKeith loves Shiro as a mentor and sometimes wishes there was more. He knows though it would out a strain on their relationship. There is nothing stopping him though to dedicating him self for him though.\nShiro guided Keith in the Garrison and continued to do so as a paladin. Through out knowing each other, their bond has grown leaps and bounds. At no point has Shiro considered, Keith romantically viable for him. He thought if he could return those feelings but there too many factors against it to even be viable.\nDone\n*Im putting myself, a 26 old person in Shiro\u2019s shoes. I don\u2019t see myself being okay dating someone under 20. They\u2019re immature and inexperienced. I may not be the most experienced adult but generally people that young need to date within their age group. I can form deep bonds maybe but never want for it to get romantic. I would love to help younger people to grow into their own person. I just wouldn\u2019t be okay for it to cross a line.\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "fiction-and-reality-are-complex", "id": 646870112063897600, "date": "2021-03-28 03:50:11 GMT", "timestamp": 1616903411, "tags": ["acco text", "discourse", "fiction discourse", "propaganda mention"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zo-XuXZw9F2DOi00", "note_count": 24, "body": "The funny thing is my cousin is a historian and training to work in history archives and legit told me stuff can't be propaganda unless it involves the real world.

What\u2019s even more frustrating is that these anons insist on policing how bloggers act, and attack them when they try to\u00a0\u201cseek out attention\u201d or whatever else. It doesn\u2019t even have anything to do with the game which is ABSURD, because how lonely, pathetic, and depraved do you have to be to skulk around this website, observe how people act, what they like etc., to be able to spew hate in their inboxes about your observed patterns of behavior of them?\nThere was the recent incident where someone was given some rude comment about her personal post about why they like something and their thoughts on why they write.. Basic rule here: you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, you don\u2019t comment. If you want to help, you help, but don\u2019t be a condescending grouch about it.\nThen when people jumped to their defense, they all received hate, some attacking them personally, because how dare people defend someone receiving anonymous hate right?\nThen today, I see a new face of the fandom, who has been working hard to post fanfic frequently and improve on their writing and interact with the fandom, barraged with hate messages. All consist of accusations of them\u00a0\u201csucking up\u201d to famous blogs and to kill themself because their writing isn\u2019t that great or whatever the fuck. It\u2019s disgusting.\n1. Not all content creators are good from the get go. This applies to everything in life that is worth doing. There has to be that period, and there has to be some space where people who start out are allowed to post things that aren\u2019t quite there yet, so they can receive critique and practice and improve. This fandom should be one of those places. Because this place isn\u2019t some company catering to an audience that pays its content creators. There is no obligation towards people to provide content and perfect content at that. The fact that stuff on here is freely consumed and that it\u2019s a FANDOM should mean that it\u2019s a place for everyone old, new, beginners, and experts.\u00a0\n2. Constructive criticism isn\u2019t the same as hate. Constructive criticism politely points out what is off about the WRITING and offers suggestions for improvement. Plainly saying you don\u2019t like the work, without pointing out why, or directing comments at the creator themself, is hate. Learn the difference.\n3. None of you have any business to observe our behaviors then attack us with it. You don\u2019t get to come into our house and point out\u00a0\u201coh I see you only liked these posts, or have commented on these posts, you must be ____\u201d because 3A.) what we do on here should be none of your business and no one has to justify to you why we like things even if there is a pattern. 3B) There is so little you can tell about people by the patterns of what they like and comment on. And assuming the worst like racism and attention-seeking and favoritism etc. is so stupid. You know nothing about people on here and you have the nerve to go around accusing people of being shitty when they are just interacting with each other.\n4. Interacting with other blogs, especially the ones who are perceived to be popular and famous, is \nnot wrong\n. I saw someone shamed for doing so, saying they were attention-seeking. So? People want to contribute and they want to be better, and these people have become figures they look up to. These figures have credibility because of their large followings so the new people look to them for advice and critique. It\u2019s the same as in real life, where if I wanted to learn how to play the guitar, I\u2019ll look up to the greats, and I\u2019ll look for experts who hold classes and have like 10000 followers because of how good they are. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this and there is not shame in it. And if you feel the need to attack someone for it, you are petty, pathetic, and jealous. Get over yourself.\n5. Telling people to kill themselves is never okay. Grow up and get a life.\n6.\u00a0\u201cBeing honest\u201d to someone in their inbox is not an excuse to be an asshole. No one probably even asked for your opinion. Keep it to yourself if it\u2019s not even remotely productive/constructive.\n7. @ those who have been victims of these idiots: turn off anon. Don\u2019t respond to the messages, but instead click the ellipses at the bottom and click block or report. It works even if they\u2019re on anon. Or if you do reply, take it as an opportunity for a joke (my personal favorite). I\u2019m one of the types who only the people I know and care about\u2019s opinions into account. So if you\u2019re some lame ass grayface, I don\u2019t care, and you\u2019re a joke to me, all I see is a child throwing a tantrum behind their computer because they\u2019re jealous.\nIn my opinion, anything said behind anon means nothing. If you cannot stand your ground and say it to someone with your name attached to your words, you are a coward. And the words are usually just empty hate that come from their pettiness and jealousy. Not a thing to give any value to, really.\nBut I know not everyone is like this, and \n\nif you find you are the type who cannot shrug off anonymous words and get very anxious and stressed out by them, you don\u2019t have to put yourself through the verbal and emotional abuse by reading and responding. Take every measure to distance yourself from this. This hobby space should be safe and fun for YOU, first and foremost.\nThis fandom should be a fun and helpful community. And I am so happy when it is. Unfortunately there will always be those bad apples lurking in the shadows, so we all have to protect ourselves.\u00a0\n\nLastly, know that you have people around you who you can look to when this shit happens and stresses you out. \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "doecourser-moved-blog", "id": 178947882800, "date": "2018-10-11 12:50:52 GMT", "timestamp": 1539262252, "tags": ["lgbt", "ace aro discourse", "exclusionist discourse", "ace exclusion", "discourse", "aro exclusion"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZP2z2Z2cg7-ym", "note_count": 40, "body": "Good morning everyone.

not to mention that the person who mocked me for supposedly not having friends did so when i said to leave me alone, and ive said publicly for people to leave me alone consistently, and. well, insulting and going after someone, or even talking about them behind their back, when they said to leave them alone is in fact harassment, by definition. \n im accused of not listening to philza, with the only clip being given to me of him talking about c!emeraldduo being like \"the platonic version of achilles and patroclus\", as if platonic = queerplatonic. yesterday was the first time i was given a clip of phil talking about qprs specifically, given to me by someone who didnt evem disagree with me anyways, again showing the people disagreeing with me were barely actually willing to cooperate with me. i have. complicated feelings on the clip (mainly with how its worded as just headcanons and only given the definition of \"platonic life partners\" which.. hm.), but this post isnt about that. \n regardless, i vent to my friends, because i was having a delusional breakdown, and one makes a post saying they didnt want to interact with the fandom after people went after me. they inform me that both people who insulted me before and others reblogged from their post to again assert that im arophobic, claim that no one was talking about me outside of people publicly talking about how \"arophobic\" i am (which.. is people talking about me), claim that i called people racist and sexist (i didnt?? i dont think anyones racist and sexist, not even for what i brought up concerning the fandoms treatment of kristin, it gives me a bad taste in my mouth, but i would never call anyone racist or sexist for it [outside of the whitewashing but thats a different issue from the qpr discussion]), and then they were sent anon hate, one even asserting that they were arophobic and talking over minority groups and therefore deserved to be in their bad home situation. outside of their post being in the dream smp tag, its hard to believe that people just. normally found their post. unless they were going through the recent posts in the dream smp tag (which i dont feel is the case), it is.. concerning that they found my friend trying to defend me so quickly and immediately decided to continue to talk about me behind my back and even insult them as well.\n so.. yknow, not great in asserting that there arent people tracking me somehow, which is \nincredibly\n triggering and paranoia inducing. \n either way, in the end, if people disagree with me about the situation, i dont care, i cant stop them, but i just want people to stop being fucking pricks about it. i want people to stop being pissy at me and about me, i want people to stop insulting me and telling me and telling people i interact with that im arophobic when im not. i want people to stop pretending to care when they tell me to take a break when \ntheyre the fucking reasons\n i have to take a break. i want people to stop being condescending to me, to stop talking about me, to stop acting like theyre superior while fucking insulting me.\n i just wanted to bring up an issue about the lack of respect kristin gets, and people as always turned it into something about philza and technoblades relationship when that was literally the behavior that i was complaining about. i hate that me wanting to talk about how kristin and her marriage to phil is treated turned into me having several breakdowns in one day because i kept getting worse and worse news about how people were treating me. i hate that i \ndid\n take breaks, that i actively distracted myself, went outside, took care of my pets, took care of myself, talked to my friends, and yet people just acted condescending and went all \"if you cant handle criticism then leave :/\". \n what the fuck is \nwrong\n with you people? why is it that this fandom actively defaults to harassment and using ccs against fans when an issue arises? and i fucking hate that this is my first goddamn actual interaction with aeduo fans. im genuinely terrified of aeduo fans now if \nthis\n is how they react to problems. fuck everyone who talked about me behind my back, fuck everyone who acted condescending towards me, fuck everyone who called me arophobic or anti-polyam or whatever the hell they had up their sleeves, fuck every single \ngrown ass adult\n who saw a teenager have a fucking breakdown over the shit they did and said and decided to \ncontinue\n. fuck everyone who didnt even bother to have a goddamn level conversation with me before insulting me and attempting to tell others that im arophobic and other shit like that. \n this shit happened because of two paragraphs. i said two goddamn paragraphs about a personal issue with the fandom i had and now ive genuinely been pushed almost to the point of relapsing. i dont give a shit if people think i have a victim complex, i just want people to \nleave\n. \nme\n. \nalone\n. its the fucking least you could do. oh, and go fuck yourself. if you genuinely thought id be apologizing after that shit, fuck you. i shouldnt have to be the better person with this shit, i shouldnt be pushed to choking on my own fucking tears because people wont let it fucking be. im not goddamn apologizing after three days of getting insulted and harassed and talked about behind my back for a fucking shipping issue. piss off."}, {"blog_name": "serowysimz", "id": 175128285551, "date": "2018-06-22 03:34:22 GMT", "timestamp": 1529638462, "tags": ["theas ted talks", "spice district", "DISCOURSE"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z_XejZ2Z6TP5l", "note_count": 0, "body": "if ur fav district isnt the spice district ur homophobic\n\n"}, {"blog_name": "zavala-swallows", "id": 178648496380, "date": "2018-10-01 23:02:44 GMT", "timestamp": 1538434964, "tags": ["gen talks", "ask to tag", "discourse", "ish"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zc9-2c2cOHxZy", "note_count": 10, "body": "Throwback to when hundreds of snowflakes got offended by an ally making a joke about a bi blogger (which was backed by said bi person themself) being \"half gay\" and they threw a fit saying it's homophobic/biphobic/bigoted to say that.

This will mostly just be me venting, but it\u2019s also a plea to everyone else too. I\u2019ll put it under the cut so it doesn\u2019t bother anyone.\u00a0\nPlease don\u2019t reblog.\nI know I\u2019m not the most likeable person in the world, but I try so hard not to upset people. I know it shouldn\u2019t, but whenever I find out someone doesn\u2019t like me my confidence and self-esteem take a \nhuge \nhit, because I try\u00a0\nso\n hard to try and be a calming, welcoming person so anyone can feel safe and comfortable with me, both online and offline.\nRecently I was blocked by someone I looked up to and admired. You know those people who you\u2019re too afraid to actually talk to, so you just quietly follow them in the hopes that someday you\u2019ll be able to work up the courage? Yeah, that kinda person.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s someone fairly well known in the fandom, but I\u2019m not going to name them because I don\u2019t want \nany \nkind of confrontation. The only reason I\u2019m even posting this is because I highly\n d\noubt they\u2019ll read this (because they have me blocked and also they just... wouldn\u2019t bother, I don\u2019t think).\u00a0It was a shock when I saw I was blocked, but at first I thought maybe it was a mistake or a misunderstanding, so I decided to message them on a different platform.\nAnyway, they messaged me back kind of bluntly, and I\u2019m not going to name and shame or\n \nshare the content of what they said to me, but it was along the lines of\u00a0\u201cyou make me uncomfortable and I\u2019m not obliged to tell you why.\u201d Which is a valid response, honestly. They didn\u2019t even need to message me back at all.\nI started panicking and asking \nwhy \nI make them uncomfortable, because even if they didn\u2019t like me I wanted to fix that so I don\u2019t scare anyone else away, but they refused to tell me. I still can\u2019t for the life of me figure out what it is that I do/have done, and I overthink a \nhell\n of a lot. When your only goal in life and your only redeeming feature is that people generally like/are neutral towards you, it kind of shattered me in a way I wasn\u2019t expecting.\nThe point of this post isn\u2019t to cause drama because, like I said, I doubt they\u2019ll even read this. I \nhope \nthey don\u2019t.\u00a0I hate confrontation and that\u2019s not what this post is for. Also I\u2019m not looking for sympathy, because I\u2019m the one who made things worse. When they wouldn\u2019t tell me what I\u2019d done wrong, I kept asking anyway. I made their mild discomfort into something way more extreme, and I feel \nso\n\u00a0guilty for that. It\u2019s not what I wanted at all. I hate being on bad terms with people.\nThe actual point of this post is to ask all of you to tell me if there\u2019s something about me that bothers you. I\u2019m trying to constantly change to be as good a person as I can be, and if I make people uncomfortable then I can\u2019t do that. So \nplease \ntell me if I ever do anything wrong, or anything that upsets you or someone you know. Whether it\u2019s a big or small issue, I want to know so I can work it out. You can send it as an anonymous ask if that makes you more comfortable.\nThis exchange I had with said person has been weighing on my mind more than you could imagine. I know it\u2019s not good to let strangers on the internet dictate how you feel, but when it\u2019s someone you admire and look up to, it\u2019s difficult not to. Without going into detail, I have a number of issues that make me overreact to things like this, but like I said, I \ndon\u2019t \nwant sympathy, because I \nknow \nI was in the wrong. I was blocked and I should have just left it and got on with my life. Unfortunately I can\u2019t seem to do that yet, but I\u2019m working on it.\nI didn\u2019t plan on making a post like this, but honestly I just don\u2019t know how else to deal with it.\nTL;DR:\n if I ever bother you or make you uncomfortable, \nplease please please\n tell me so I can work on it."}, {"blog_name": "eac101", "id": 172639223048, "date": "2018-04-06 00:20:35 GMT", "timestamp": 1522974035, "tags": ["happy feet", "discourse", "incel", "chad", "mumble", "animated movies", "memes", "funny", "ruined childhood"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPMHHj2Wo6Nq8", "note_count": 0, "body": "Mumble from Happy Feet is an incel\n"}, {"blog_name": "hiddenobjectfiles", "id": 154208213911, "date": "2016-12-08 16:05:30 GMT", "timestamp": 1481213130, "tags": ["cheating", "walkthroughs", "discourse", "sea", "tropes"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZlEjKf2FdXfkN", "note_count": 0, "body": "SMOFs and Ships\nThis week I was away SMOFing, and perhaps coincidentally, Sea of Lies: Beneath the Surface was on special offer on Big Fish.

we can't just look at the western-european world here- rape happens everywhere\nthe term \"normalization\" needs to be defined in a quantitative, testable way, or to abandon its quantitative assertions altogether: is there a positive correlation between the telling of rape jokes in an environment and the number of rapes perpetrated in the same?\nits acceptance as a priori truth without quantitative substantiation also lends the rape culture hypothesis very well to racist scaremongering: witness the current european nativist attempts to characterize near eastern refugees as somehow \"more prone to rape\" as a result of their cultural background, and thus a danger to white european society- it's impossible to adequately combat this claim unless the hypothesis is made rigorously empirical, rather than idealistic and nebulous\nas a closing note, \"RAINN, one of North America's leading anti-sexual violence organizations, in a report detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, identifies problems with an overemphasis on the concept of rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, \"In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime.\" \u00a0It is estimated that in college, 90% of rapes are committed by 3-7% of the male population, though it is stipulated that RAINN does not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators. RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that the trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape \"has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions\".\"\nthis reflects some of my concerns about the distorting nature of the narrative; and rainn can hardly be called an association with a vested interest in promoting or defending sexual violence"}, {"blog_name": "untcldcwn", "id": 177294601930, "date": "2018-08-23 03:45:12 GMT", "timestamp": 1534995912, "tags": ["ambo.talks", "discourse", "i guess"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPaejc2b7bExA", "note_count": 8, "body": "because i'm in a Big Angry mood it's so sad that obscure shit like lithromantic and mogai identities get on pride posts before lesbians. we are literally the L in LGBT. your lesbophobia is showing lol. \n\n"}, {"blog_name": "27zerp-blog", "id": 161228151927, "date": "2017-05-30 04:26:08 GMT", "timestamp": 1496118368, "tags": ["discourse", "nonbinary", "nonbinary discourse", "nonbinary discussion"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZvLTrd2M9ybnt", "note_count": 5, "body": "@ everyone who argues that nonbinary \u201cisn\u2019t a real gender\u201d\nyou do realize that you saying shit like that... is useless and accomplishes nothing, right? nonbinary people will still be nonbinary. go do something more productive, like feeding the homeless"}, {"blog_name": "oy-jay", "id": 146281313222, "date": "2016-06-22 00:26:48 GMT", "timestamp": 1466555208, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZCVW3k28F2xF6", "note_count": 11, "body": "here's a discourse we can all get behind:\nloving ourselves"}, {"blog_name": "specterpeach", "id": 169434178704, "date": "2018-01-07 19:55:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1515354925, "tags": ["ghost speaks", "discourse", "i'm reeeeally sick of fandom policing", "it's obnoxious and petty", "we're all trying to have fun", "well at least i am", "seriously nobody died and made anyone a fandom authority", "knock it off"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZX0GAy2Tp46IG", "note_count": 3, "body": "this just in: people are allowed to have headcanons you don\u2019t like. stop being salty little buttholes about it and trying to\u00a0\u201cdebunk\u201d them"}, {"blog_name": "infirm-of-purpose", "id": 159761506183, "date": "2017-04-19 19:01:22 GMT", "timestamp": 1492628482, "tags": ["discourse", "mtg story"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZylNQv2KoXn_7", "note_count": 1, "body": "I just think it\u2019s funny that Jace and Lilliana can be implied to be actually fucking but Nissa and Chandra get edited down to an awkward confusing mess about friendship"}, {"blog_name": "theoreticallyjasper", "id": 656814434729263104, "date": "2021-07-15 22:10:57 GMT", "timestamp": 1626387057, "tags": ["again i wanna stress that if you bought from them previously before all this shit happened i don\u2019t care. you didn\u2019t know. it\u2019s fine", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZKBPuWaTUJ_POm00", "note_count": 3, "body": "lol yeah if you still support youtooz unfollow me. i don\u2019t care if you entered a contests or bought from them in the past or something but if you\u2019re still gonna buy from them after all the art theft/underpayment shit has come out i don\u2019t want you anywhere near me"}, {"blog_name": "magickalvoid", "id": 160894902912, "date": "2017-05-21 03:10:22 GMT", "timestamp": 1495336222, "tags": ["lmao", "that person can fuck off", "they're probs a twerf too", "witchcraft", "discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZlB7je2Ls5MA0", "note_count": 14, "body": "Me, scrolling through the witchcraft tag: *sees a post titled \"Do you have to be a woman to be a witch?\"*\n\nTheir short answer: yes\n\nMe, a demiboy witch, already blocking the person: what?"}, {"blog_name": "squinko", "id": 666059801105727488, "date": "2021-10-25 23:22:05 GMT", "timestamp": 1635204125, "tags": ["discourse"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZP4CgSa_KTmq4m00", "note_count": 2, "body": "This post is inspired by ilya tubbolive (hi ilya) but please don\u2019t feel forced to say stuff on the situation so people dont assume you don\u2019t care, you dont owe people anything!

I like being in the fandom.\n\nAt least, I used to.\n\nNow, I find that every fandom I try to enter - and even some that I only know of in passing - there is discourse. Sometimes it's over trivial things, sometimes not, but it is always there, and I find it's unavoidable. For everyone who tags their discourse, there are still people who don't, whether intentionally or through an oversight. And I'm tired of it.\n\nI go to fandom to relax. I go to get away from everyday life. I don't go to see people arguing. Sure, maybe the problems are real. Maybe something is problematic. I'm not saying that the subjects of fandom discourse aren't real problems; many certainly are. I just wish that people would debate civilly rather than condemning anyone whose opinions they disagree with. I just wish that I could enjoy content without having to pick a side. I just wish that I could avoid it at all.\n\nFor all that we on Tumblr preach inclusivity, discourse is ostracizing. Not only does one side get pushed out of main fandom spaces, or both sides alienated from each other, but it pushes away those like me who only want to enjoy fandom without being pulled into an argument.\n\nWe need to change this part of modern fandom culture. It's toxic, it's exhausting, and instead of pulling us together, it's dividing us."}]
