During Queen Victoria\u2019s reign, it was refurbished, and open to the public for tours starting around 1849. \nAssuming Jonathan is a contemporary of the era Dracula was published in - the 1890s - he could easily have visited (which reminds me of a mistake I made last post- since it\u2019s the 90s, Dracula is Edwardian, not Victorian, though Queen Victoria wouldn\u2019t die til 1901. But the fashion period is Edwardian. Adjust ur canary accordingly)\nThe \u201cservants bell\u201d Jonathan looks for and misses would be a bell in a fancy rope that would ring a connected bell in the downstairs servants\u2019 quarters, alerting staff that someone in his room needed assistance. It\u2019s VERY strange that there isn\u2019t one, given Jonathan\u2019s observations of Dracula\u2019s visible wealth (tapestries, castle). In this era a house like this could only be maintained properly by a full staff. Even though Drac is the only resident, there would still be a cook, butler, housekeeper, footman, driver, and several maids-of-all-work. Their absence is conspicuous, except to Jonathan, who as an upper class Englishman automatically disregards the presence or absence of servants.\nThe \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d books mentioned are diplomatic anthologies. England\u2019s famous \nBlue Book\n, dating to the 17th century, is a compilation of diplomatic correspondence and seems to have been annually or semi-annually published, allowing readers some transparency of government. The red book specifically I couldn\u2019t find in my lunch break, but I suspect a similar premise.\nBradshaw\u2019s Guide, as others have posted abt, is a combination railway timetable and travel guide, first produced in the 1830s. Dracula seems to be very thorough in studying English ways\u2026\nThe mention of the \u2018patronymic\u2019 is a reference to Jonathan\u2019s surname. A patronymic strictly speaking references a name as in the Icelandic style, with \u201cson\u201d or \u201cdaughter\u201d appended to the father\u2019s first name, but as England does hand down last names patrilineally, through the father, I think this is probably still correct usage.

in the 1800s was the suspense that came from reading second hand accounts of stories and/or unreliable narrators. dracula, frankenstein, edgar allan poe, dr jekyll and mr hyde and hp lovecraft all have this. the protagonist either reads diary entries made by the victim, observes the victim from afar or listens to an old crazy man recounting the events. lt was scary because you didnt know who you can trust to speak the truth and you werent there to confirm it. in the case of dracula you dont know if you can rely on jonathan recounting the story faithfully"}, {"blog_name":

I have only the Count to speak with, and he!\u2014I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place.\nSo up till now everyone's been gently making fun of Jonathan for plowing right through the red flags, but he's really quite quick on the uptake.  Remember, he lives in a world with no concept of vampires.  For Jonathan, a vampire is a black swan.  There is no genre to be savvy about.  And despite that, it takes him barely four days to come to the conclusion that Dracula is not human.  (Okay, he gets some pretty big clues in the last 24 hours, but still.)\nWhen the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\nI'm loving all the little differences from current vampire lore.  Dracula's not described as recoiling from the crucifix here; it just makes him able to control his bloodlust.\nAh, young sir, the Szekelys\u2014and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and their swords\u2014can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.\"\nSo do we think Dracula leaving out the House of Hanover is being polite to his English guest, or is that just Stoker displaying British Imperial exceptionalism?

So now I got to defend my boy. \nSo the vibe I\u2019ve always gotten from the opening bit with Jonathan was less \u201cthe character who doesn\u2019t realize what genre they are in\u201d and more \u201chuh, these sure are a lot of horror red flags. Odd. But this is the real world so I\u2019m just being paranoid. Now I\u2019ll continue with what I was doing- huh, weird. That\u2019s another horror flag. Mina will love hearing about how odd this trip has been so far\u201d \nBut then he just keeps tripping over horror flags until he eventually realizes he actually IS in a horror novel. \nI actually find this a much better alternative to the oblivious horror protagonist trope, because obviously if a real person started encountering horror red flags like that in the real world they would be creeped out but ultimately continue with their day because this is the real world and real people don\u2019t get eaten by monsters. Sure, some of us would just nope right out of there because we aren\u2019t taking that chance. But ultimately Jonathan isn\u2019t a superstitious person, so while he notices the bad omens accumulating around him he dismisses them at first because to do otherwise would be foolish in his mind. Especially because if he just leaves without an actually good reason he\u2019ll probably be fired from what is presumably a very well paying job. I mean he\u2019s literally being paid to go meet foreign royalty and help them buy some property. If I was sent to help the queen of England purchase an American beach house I couldn\u2019t just leave and tell my boss that the queen definitely wanted to eat me, that would be crazy. \nSo tl:dr cut my boi Jonathan some slack. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s unaware he\u2019s in a horror novel. It\u2019s that he\u2019s unaware he\u2019s a fictional character in the first place.

He's descriptive but doesn't indulge too much (if you've read other literature of the time you know - this is the age of writers getting paid a dime a word). The suspence buildup during all of the coach ride(s) is very well made. The setting feels rooted in reality despite the hints of supernatural stuff. The mixture of charming and repulsive in Dracula himself still gets to me - it's an effect many writers have tried to achieve and failed.\nAlso, for all that we are meming poor Jonathan to death, his hesitation feels reasonable to me. I mean: he's in a foreign country where he doesn't speak the language, in an extremely isolated place to booth, with no maps or knowledge of the area at all. What is he supposed to do besides following the itinerary that has been prepared for him so graciously by this Count, who has very obviously spent a ton of money on this deal? Let's say he decides to go back to England - what is he gonna say to his boss, that he got spooked and ran off and ruined the biggest deal ever for both of them? He's gonna get fired just after passing the bar exam! And what of poor Mina! \nIt's like haunted house stories: people are like \"why didn't they move???\" but like telling your bank \"hey remember the house you gave us a mortgage on, well it's haunted, we need to leave it and buy another immediately\" isn't exactly going to work, is it?
