Bad enough to learn that the Spanish are following them while being yelled at by a short, angry man. Worse for it all to be happening while Stede is staggering around, barely able to function past his stab wound. Catastrophic for this whole disaster to take place in front of Blackbeard.\nThere\u2019s a moment, right in the middle of it all, when Stede has just broken down crying in front of the greatest pirate of all time, and then walks onto the deck of the ship to hear Blackbeard explain all the ways he has already solved the problem, that Stede feels like he might just choke in the face of his own inadequacy.\nHe feels absolutely rotten for thinking like that. For getting jealous and maudlin in the face of someone helping to save his crew. He feels even worse when, just a moment later, Ed is spiraling and drinking straight from the decanter in the captain\u2019s quarters.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I thought I would die,\u201d Ed says, staring into the amber liquid as he swirls it around its crystal container.\nThis is exactly how I thought I would die\n, Stede thinks. \nAway from my family after making a fool of myself in front of everyone I know. \nHe gets down the painting that Mary gave him, that she painted for him. A painting of all the things he should have been and failed to be for his family. Any decent man can be a lighthouse. All you have to do is stand there. Stay in one place and be a good example of what to do.\n\u201cTechnically, you\u2019re supposed to avoid lighthouses,\u201d Ed says.\nStede\u2019s first thought is: that\u2019s about the only thing I ever got right.\nStede\u2019s second thought, in tandem with Ed\u2019s, is: we need to be a lighthouse.\nAnd it\u2019s, wow, it\u2019s truly incredible to watch someone as brilliant a tactician as Blackbeard get to work on a scheme. He darts around Stede\u2019s quarters, grabbing at a mirror, a lantern, and a spyglass. All Stede can do is hunch in the chaise, answering questions when Ed articulates them over his quiet mutterings.\nWhen he has all his materials, Ed swings back around to Stede, and his eyes are shining bright with excitement.\n\u201cCome on, we have to go set this shit up,\u201d he enthuses, already on his way out the door. Stede is left strangely winded and stumbles his way up to the main deck with one hand on the wall.\nIt\u2019s still foggy outside, so much so that it takes a moment for Stede to find Ed over by the side of the ship, waving his hands in the air and talking enthusiastically to several members of Stede\u2019s crew.\nThey\u2019re all watching him raptly as he speaks. How wonderful, that they get the chance to experience multiple styles of captaining.\nEd catches his glance and grins when he sees Stede. He looks\u2026excited. To see \nStede\n. That is something that must be given greater consideration at some other time, when they aren\u2019t about to die and there isn\u2019t a fake lighthouse to build.\nBut, then, Stede is too injured to climb up and down the rigging the way that Ed is so effortlessly doing. He mostly just sits there while the crew moves around him.\nLucius is muttering to himself in the corner, but he runs off to fetch anything that Ed asks of him. Black Pete is right in the action of construction, eagerly following every direction that Blackbeard gives. One time, he even sees Black Pete grab a rope out of Frenchie\u2019s hands when the other man gets to a task first. For Frenchie\u2019s part, he lets go of the rope and shrugs casually, stepping off to the side to watch the others get to work. Oluwande and Jim (does she still go by Jim? Stede should investigate this. It\u2019s important to address others the way they wish to be addressed, when you\u2019re using a people-positive management style) are diligently tying the different materials into a neat contraption to be ferried up to the crow\u2019s nest. The others are all contributing where they can get an edge in, while Buttons occasionally yells out an update on the Spanish\u2019s position (mostly the fact that he can\u2019t see anything in the fog).\nIt\u2019s wonderful to see everyone so motivated and active. Goodness, but this is exactly what Stede had been picturing when he set off for this adventure. A crew gleefully working together to build a clever trick to outwit their enemies.\nStede thinks again of the shining way Ed had looked at him when he stepped on deck. Even though he said he would put it off for later, Stede can\u2019t help thinking about the fact that he can\u2019t remember if anyone has ever looked happy to see him. Maybe the children, when they were younger. But an adult? Someone who had the chance to see him in all of his incompetence and idiocy?\nThe whole night feels like a rose-tinted dream. Like something tremulous and untouchable. A wavering flame on a wax-covered and snow-damp candle wick.\nLucius thinks to suggest a pulley to lift Stede up into the crows nest, and Oluwande and Jim get to work making that too, talking quietly amongst themselves.\nHe\u2019s being hoisted into the sky. With the fog as dense as it is, Stede can\u2019t even see the deck below. It\u2019s just this small, round perch in a sea of gray. Just him and Ed, still wearing Stede\u2019s clothes, with the luxurious beard. The clouds muffle any sound and make it feel even more as though Stede is walking in a dream.\nEd hands him the decanter, and Stede savors the burn of the whiskey like a pinch on the arm. No matter how many times he drinks, the dream doesn\u2019t go away.\nThe mirror spins around and around. The breeze it creates tousles Ed\u2019s hair. The lantern is spinning too, and it casts shifting light and shadow across the expressive planes of Ed\u2019s face. He\u2019s not looking at Stede, staring out into the fog and pausing to gesture down to Frenchie.\nHe\u2019s focused. The orange light sets off the warm brown tones in his skin and puddles in the ink darkness of his eyes.\nWhat a spectacular man. They always say you shouldn\u2019t meet your heroes, and that just goes to show how extraordinary Blackbeard is. Because Stede didn\u2019t even know to imagine half of the things that have already happened today.\nHe\u2019d had no idea.\nWhen they hear the calls ringing out over the water, the fleet of Spanish communicating their intent to turn around between ships, Ed slings an arm tight and warm around Stede\u2019s shoulders and shakes him.\nIt\u2019s warm and close. The shifting orange light is still swinging around them and Stede feels something clicking in his heart.\u00a0\nHe had always imagined a life at sea. The boys, Mary, his father, even his crew. They had all assured him that Stede was not meant for this. The elder on the island, even Stede himself. But this, \nthis\n was what his heart had been calling out for all these years. A night of success, with a crew that worked together and Blackbeard himself pleased as punch.\nEd shakes him again, and the blaze of pain from his stab wound is an undeniable indication that this somehow isn\u2019t a dream.\nThere is a candle in Stede\u2019s chest.\n*~*~*\nOkay, so it was a fun night. A miraculous escape, just like always, but this had been \ndifferent\n. This was more than a good fight, or a quick escape in the night. This was a balls-to-the-wall, batshit crazy plan to pretend to be a fucking \nlighthouse\n. Hell, the \u201cfoghorn\u201d had just been a guy yelling!\nAnd it had fucking \nworked\n.\nHe and Stede stay up in the crows nest. Mostly to keep watch in case the ships turn back around, though it\u2019s impossible to see and there\u2019s no way they would. The man falls asleep just a few minutes into watch, and that makes sense. Recovering from a stab wound and everything. Plus, this was probably more excitement than Stede had experienced in his life.\nEd can\u2019t sleep. He\u2019s keeping watch, but mostly he\u2019s buzzing with adrenaline. His body\u2019s always been like this. He never knows what will get him properly excited, but once it happens he takes hours longer to come down than everyone else.\nHe sits in the foggy darkness and watches the clouds slide past him.\nSo. The Gentleman Pirate. An absolute madman and a frankly terrible pirate. A top-rate co-conspirator and a relatively effective lighthouse. He\u2019s overeager and seems to have all the common sense of a small dog, but Ed can\u2019t help but like him.\nStede is also, somehow, quite handsome. His hair is still lanky and his body rank from fever-sweat. His skin is pale from blood loss and there\u2019s a bright red stripe all the way around his neck. Even without the sickness, he\u2019s not a conventionally attractive man. There\u2019s no reason for Ed to feel a low buzz of hunger under his skin. The beast is simultaneously intrigued and appalled by this. But, Ed can\u2019t stop thinking of the way Stede had looked so shocked and thrilled when their plan had worked. How he had gone around talking to each member of his crew while they were setting things up, trying to help and often making things worse.\nHe might not be pretty, but he was \nnew\n, and that had always been far more intriguing to Ed\u2019s magpie brain.\nThis is, unequivocally, the most dangerous thing that has ever happened to Ed.\nHis soulmate. Of course \nthis \nwould be his fucking soulmate. He\u2019d never really bothered imagining what they would be like, but even if he had, Ed would challenge anyone in the world to be prepared to meet Stede Bonnet.\nHe can feel the prickling interest under his skin, the urge to poke and prod and learn everything new. His fucking soulmate. This was a ticking fucking time bomb.\nHe thinks again of the perfect layout of the captain\u2019s quarters. The decor of the rooms he\u2019d ducked his head in over the course of the night. Blackbeard may be rich, but it was perfectly clear that he and Stede were from completely different worlds. That all these beautiful things weren\u2019t meant for him and he has never had and will never have the first idea of how to exist in that sphere.\nFuck. He\u2019s gotta, fucking, he doesn\u2019t fucking know. But Stede Bonnet is his soulmate and he\u2019s already getting under his skin, and Ed can\u2019t afford to let this go on. He\u2019s going to have to do, fucking, something. He has to stop this. Fuck, but this is fucking \ndangerous\n.\nThese thoughts circle around his head for hours before Ed finally slips into sleep, leaning against the mast. By the time it happens, he\u2019s started to sketch the outlines of a plan.\n*~*~*\n\u201cLucius,\u201d Stede hisses over the side of the crows nest. \u201cPsst, \nLucius\n.\u201d Lucius still doesn\u2019t wake up but, at the noise, Stede sees Roach jerk to a seated position and glance around frantically. Oh, that works even better.\n\u201cOh, Roach, perfect!\u201d Stede watches as Roach continues to glance around for the source of the voice and, when he can\u2019t find it, reaches over to shake Frenchie awake. \u201cUp here, Roach.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he finally says, sighing with relief when he looks up. \u201cGood morning captain.\u201d\n\u201cRoach, I need you to put together a full breakfast and hoist it up here for me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, captain,\u201d said Roach, skeptically. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it would make it all the way up there without the sausages rolling off the plate, and the breakfast isn\u2019t the same without it.\u201d He paused for a moment to gaze around himself consideringly. \u201cActually, with weather like this, and with a view like that, I think you really need something a bit simpler. To match the ambiance, you know?\u201d\nStede and Roach had butted heads a bit when Stede had first put his crew together. Roach was one of the crew that Stede was sure had suffered a fair amount of trauma, and he\u2019d been quick to try and establish himself as something of a \u201chead honcho\u201d on the ship. He had accomplished this by not working very hard on the group activities and rolling his eyes a lot when Stede talked.\nBut, Stede was never one to let blatant disrespect and derision stop him. The first few proper conversations Stede had managed to wrangle with him had mostly focused on the different ways he wanted to torture the hostages. Stede didn\u2019t condone violence on his ship but, after the few times he heard the way the hostages spoke to some of the members of his crew, particularly the men of color, Stede couldn\u2019t really blame Roach for wanting to work out a bit of his aggression.\nAnd then, just as Stede had desperately hoped for, there was an opportunity for them to bond. Roach started out as a fairly good cook, but his combinations of flavors had been\u2026creative at best. When Stede had stepped into the galley to subtly try and figure out what was going on, he found Roach, Oluwande, and the Swede rummaging through the food stores and genuinely trying to figure out what the foods were.\nStede really should have thought of that. He understood that his palate was quite a bit more developed than the average pirate and that, generally, dining isn\u2019t a main focus when stocking a ship. No wonder Roach was struggling with his flavors! He likely didn\u2019t have any experience using these ingredients.\nSo, Stede had made sure to buy a cookbook or two the next time they restocked. A few days after that, Stede had walked past the galley in the hours before a meal and heard Lucius and Roach gossiping while Lucius read recipes aloud, interspersed with comments such as \u201cis it supposed to look like that?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the one over here is boiling, but I have no idea what to do about that.\u201d\nAnd Roach had absolutely blossomed! He had already been a bold and experimental cook. Now, with a few recipes for structure, he had a better idea of what everything tasted like and what flavors went together. Most of the time, these days, Roach would create something completely new and unique for dinner and Stede watched as his and Lucius\u2019s conversations became almost entirely gossip. Sometimes Wee John and Frenchie would pile in the galley and join them, and Stede could hear Roach snapping at them to \nget the fuck out of the way before that milk boils and we all suffer for it\n.\nIn all of this, Stede and Roach had finally found something to talk about, and often spent several hours together on Sundays brainstorming the meals for the week and deciding what needed to be restocked.\nAll of this to say, when Roach says that the ambiance calls for a simple breakfast, Stede trusts him implicitly and eagerly waves a hand to indicate that he should go and put something together. When Roach returns with the orange marmalade and hunks of soft, fresh bread, Stede knows that he was right to trust the man.\n\u201cQuick, hoist it up to me!\u201d he calls. \u201cI would come down and get it, but I can\u2019t make my way up and down this rigging. I\u2019ll have to get some of the boys to lower me down when they finally wake up.\u201d\nRoach nods seriously and wraps the breakfast in a cloth, then ties that cloth to the same pulley system they used to get Stede up here.\n\u201cThank you, Roach!\u201d Stede calls down again, in a loud whisper meant to carry without waking up Ed sleeping next to him.\n\u201cEnjoy, captain! Also, when Blackbeard wakes up, can you ask him if he\u2019s going to kill us all? Some of the boys were wondering.\u201d\n\u201cSurely he won\u2019t!\u201d Stede calls down, forgetting to whisper for a moment. \u201cWhat was last night if not a team-building activity? No one is going to kill each other now.\u201d\nRoach gives a significant pause. The significant pause that Stede always knows is supposed to mean something and is never able to figure out the meaning of. \u201cMaybe just ask him anyway, when he wakes up.\u201d\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll ask him, if it comes up naturally. Honestly, Roach, you\u2019re being paranoid.\u201d\nRoach rolls his eyes one more time, as Stede stops leaning over the side, but Stede has decided that he probably means the eye rolls fondly these days. He figures if he goes on believing this long enough that it might become true.\nSighing, Stede tears off a piece of bread, dips it in the marmalade, and looks out over the sea. It\u2019s a gorgeous morning after the fog of last night, and the sunrise is painting the sea in all sorts of lovely colors. The second he takes a bite, he knows he was right to trust Roach\u2019s judgment.\nIt\u2019s a shame for anyone to miss out on something so beautiful.\n*~*~*\nEd wakes up to an elbow nudging him in the side. His first moment of consciousness is spent in a blind panic, gasping for breath like he\u2019s coming up for air after spending the whole night underwater. It\u2019s always like this, when someone else wakes him up. Sometimes when he wakes up naturally. Stede doesn\u2019t seem to notice.\nStede. The fucking soulmate. Who is sitting in the fucking sunrise as if he doesn\u2019t \nknow\n that the red sky is catching in his yellow-orange hair and setting him on fire. Bastard.\nRed fucking sky at morning.\n\u201cTry this,\u201d he says, completely oblivious to Ed\u2019s rage-filled internal monologue.\nA monologue that comes to a screeching halt when he takes the first bite of a piece of bread. There\u2019s marmalade on it, but it\u2019s like no marmalade he\u2019s ever tasted. There\u2019s a sweetness and a tartness and a spice to it that settles on his tongue and coats the bread evenly. Fuck. How is it so good? Ed\u2019s fucking eaten marmalade before. There is no way that the spectrum of marmalade quality is this wide. What the fuck.\nStede\u2019s staring out over the sea, not even looking at Ed, and it seems like a night\u2019s sleep did him a world of good. The man is wearing Ed\u2019s clothes and smiling absently while the wind tugs at his hair. There is bread in his hand and he keeps absentmindedly offering more to Ed. The marmalade tastes like a sunrise. It tastes like licking frosting off his fingers when he wakes up to a cake in his hand. They are sitting in a perch above the rest of the world and it\u2019s like nothing Ed has ever experienced before.\nBeautiful things,\n he reminds himself.\nWe\u2019re just not those kind of people.\nEd knows better than to think that he\u2019s the sort of creature who settles down with a soulmate on a cozy fucking ship full of kind-hearted imbeciles. He knows better than that. He knows what kind of thing he is.\n\u201cYou could teach me the ways of being a gentleman,\u201d he says, setting the first step of the plan he made last night into motion.\nEd is not the kind of person who other people stick around for, and a soulmate that makes his heart go all fucking pitter-patter is exactly the sort of thing that needs to be excised. A knife digging a bullet out of its entry hole.\nAnd, while he\u2019s at it, Ed is going to steal it all back. Everything his soulmate ever stole from him. With interest. And he\u2019s going to steal the knowledge of how to properly use it. He\u2019s going to spit in the eye of every person who ever looked at him funny, and he\u2019s going to walk the walk and talk the talk and retire to some town where he can live the rest of his life in luxury without ever thinking about this blip on the radar of a person.\nSure, it hurts now. Cutting people out has always hurt Ed, no matter how many times he\u2019s had to do it. The point is that, as long as he does it as soon as possible, it can\u2019t hurt as much as it would have later.

You've just put Stede No Survival Instincts Bonnet into what may be the only environment more dangerous for him than pirating, they were probably expecting it to happen at some point or another. and ed? from that brief interaction? easily looks like grief. then factor in how fucking delighted izzy is about the turn of events, and well... stede being dead is pretty much the only thing that makes sense.\n(they're all sitting there kinda talking around it, fang's probably talking about how he was quite worried for stede, in the navy and all, and swede's like 'blackbeard seems very sad' and buttons is all 'ahhh but mr hands is in a very good mood' and no one wants to say it until frenchie's just \"so the captain, uh, stede, i mean... he's uh... maybe... ?\" and jim's just like \"dead.\" and there's a big uncomfortable chorus of \"very dead\" \"definitely dead\" \"absolutely deceased\" (lucius) and they all make a beeline for the rum)\ni have a bunch more to say about why i think izzy knows stede's alive and also how \"the crew thinks stede is dead\" makes the rest of ep 10 read different but it is way too late and this is way too long already so i'll come back to that in the morning"}, {"blog_name": "black-beacon", "id": 683200336530472960, "date": "2022-05-03 04:03:33 GMT", "timestamp": 1651550613, "tags": ["alternatively: Mary is also trans but \ud83e\udd37 this is funnier", "ofmd", "our flag means death", "please dont hate me gay pirate fandom"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZBen2SbxDnOPKu00", "note_count": 19, "body": "My bf and I were trying to figure out how to trans Stede's gender (cause we're gay and t4t and we make everything else gay and t4t cause we're cool and sexy like that) but the whole \"he has kids with Mary\" thing was a big stumbling block to that until......\nThey're not actually Stede's kids \ud83e\udd2d \"I thought Doug was our dad\" because HE LITERALLY IS.\nAnd I see your \"Stede would know they're not his\" and raise you that Stede doesn't know how babies are made re:how horrified he was seeing Mary and Doug have sex.\nIs this cracky as all hell?

Meanwhile, when it comes to other people, I firmly believe that all it takes to be trans is...not being cis, and that medically transitioning is one way of being trans that\u2019s good for many people but is not a requirement, and also that gender expression =/= gender identity. But when it comes to myself, I\u2019ve just kept feeling like I\u2019m not [fill-in-the-blank] enough to claim transness. It\u2019s like, I spent twenty years feeling not [fill-in-the-blank] enough to really be queer in terms of my sexual orientation, and then I finally accepted that, and then spent another eight years trying to deny my own gender identity. But yeah, for some reason, watching \nOFMD \nhelped change that. My identity hasn\u2019t actually changed, I\u2019ve just...accepted myself.\n5.

In most cases for men the undershirt fell to their mid-thigh or knee and was tucked into the pants (bloomers were also not a thing yet, and historically accurate bloomers were crotchless) \nCorsets\n - 1700s stays were similar but not the same, also no one was being tight laced at the time\nWindows/portholes below deck\n - In the Captain\u2019s cabin the big bay window would be relatively normal, and if guns (cannons) are kept below the main deck there would probably be gun ports. The rest of below deck would likely be very dark \nRubbing alcohol \n- in a world where the booze options were pretty much beer, wine, rum, whiskey, and moonshine, why would they have rubbing alcohol? In a pinch they might have gin but that was largely produced in England at the time. I suggest moonshine or rum for period accurate disinfection (also boiled water)\nPain medication \n- see the above note on available alcohol \nCake frosting\n - glaze is fine\nBedside tables in the crew's quarters\n - crew's quarters are generally not meant for comfort and crew members tended to keep their property in bags. They might have had narrow bunks, bedrolls, or hammocks to sleep in and store their things. Where the crew slept depended very much on the individual ship.\nfeel free to add anything on!

Maybe? But it wasn't necessarily... organic.\u00a0\nLike, what if they figured out that him brushing out her hair at night was a good way to get both of them loosened up a bit, a signal and a secret code that almost felt like a love language in its way.\u00a0\nWhat if they had INTRICATE \nHETEROSEXUAL\n RITUALS.\n\n\n\n\nBasically I want to write a little series called \u201cScenes from a Marriage,\u201d okay, with every fic being just two chapters, tracing Stede/Mary and Stede/Ed through their relationships-- and in the last story, the first chapter is Stede and Mary at their \nbest,\n like when they'd gotten pretty much as good as they were going to get with each other (but maybe an inkling of realizing this \nis\n as good as they're going to get, and they're starting to realize that that is maybe \nthe saddest imaginable thing)\n, and then the second chapter is Stede and Ed and it's mirrored and parallel stuff from the first chapter but is also much more organic and fun.\nI\u2019m just. I'm super interested in the idea that Stede may be emotionally unclear on what love is, but he did manage to have two dang children and become body-comfortable with Mary -- he can sleep in the same bed as her, he can touch her bare skin, they undress in the same room together (without servants!), and he accepts her hugs and leans back into them too. Like, they figured \nsomething\n out. It just wasn't all either of them was capable of.\n\n\nBut I also feel it's... an important thing to talk about from an older-generation-queer perspective? Like, there's a \"blushing virgin\" trope appearing in a lot of fic that isn't necessarily there because it's interesting to explore, but rather because there's an assumption that maybe Stede always knew he didn't like Sex With Women? Which idk, that feels like a very modern idea of what it's like to be queer, and it's GOOD that the Kids These Days believe that if you Don't Want That Kind Of Sex Then You Don't Have To Have It... but it's also not the case for a whole bunch of people historically and, well, right now.\n\n\n(Also it plays into some of the harmful queer narratives, like \"I am finally dating the kind of person I want to date, so therefore if I feel gross about something in the relationship it must be a holdover from hetero stuff and not What's Happening Wrong In \nThis\n Relationship\")\n\n\n\n\nMaybe Stede and Mary could actually work up to having a pretty decent time! But the \nworking up\n to it was... a lot of work. And more often than not it just seemed too tiring to put in the effort, and so instead it sort of devolves to something they plan for anniversaries or holidays or something, and they both feel kind of miserable about it but they can't figure out how to fix it either.\nCompulsive heterosexuality is complicated, is what I mean. Compulsive \nsexuality\n is complicated. And I just want to explore that a little."}, {"blog_name": "death-by-sc0tland", "id": 683010807760601088, "date": "2022-05-01 01:51:05 GMT", "timestamp": 1651369865, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7u1ZVbwYhN_Ki00", "note_count": 8, "body": "i need access to the script of ofmd. for scientific purposes."}, {"blog_name": "acepunks", "id": 683269254039191552, "date": "2022-05-03 22:18:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1651616338, "tags": ["we're holding a summoning circle for him and stede to kiss btw", "I've said it b4 and I'll say it again: every lesbian responding to my poll and saying yes he's hot i am kissing u on the lips", "ace txt", "izzy hands", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z62A9ubxTSGqyy00", "note_count": 102, "body": "sorry but me and all the other lesbians who think izzy is hot are sitting in a circle holding hands and we can't hear you complain about him over the sound of our shared good taste"}, {"blog_name": "picture-of-grace", "id": 683372322440249344, "date": "2022-05-05 01:37:12 GMT", "timestamp": 1651714632, "tags": ["stede bonnet gives me hope that i cant take control of my life and do wtvr the fuck i want just to make myself happy consequences be damned", "stede bonnet", "our flag means death", "ofmd", "ofmd stede", "ofmd stede bonnet"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZRE_rbbxqu6mOe00", "note_count": 32, "body": "something so personal to me is that no matter how much of a coward stede thinks himself to be hes actually incredibly brave, like very few people have the courage to see that they are unhappy in their life, and then just Do Something About It\nlike he couldve easily dreamt about buying a boat and being a pirate for the rest of his life and just died in a miserable marriage with a family that doesnt really like him always wanting better but never acting on it BUT HE DIDNT. he didnt. he went out and he bought the ship and he hired the crew and he left his family behind because he knew he could never be happy that way as much as it pained him to leave them. he did it for himself and he chased what made him happy instead of accepting that hed never be able to pull it off and giving up hope and I love him so so much for that"}, {"blog_name": "summerstede", "id": 683632707746562048, "date": "2022-05-07 22:35:55 GMT", "timestamp": 1651962955, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "blackbonnet", "the beach boys", "ofmd soundtrack", "our prayer", "stede bonnet", "edward teach"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z9Uuotbym5DU4e00", "note_count": 27, "body": "God that needle drop at the end of ep 3.

A childhood of bullying and an expectation of conformity has left me completely Alienated from the life I was expected to live, but since I grew up so separated from the life I wanted I don\u2019t fit in there either. Most decisions I make don\u2019t have the approval of those around me, and when I make decisions on my own I end up hurting people. I\u2019ve burned all my bridges while trying to light my way home. \nEdward:\n I know one day the love of my life will see my unsavory upbringing and I hate to admit that those parts of me still exist. The exact type of people they look down on. And it\u2019s so easy to run back to bad decisions when things get tough. I\u2019m afraid that if my love ever meets those from my past that it will only confirm that I am a bad person and that the people I once called family will be revealed as people who never really supported me and that I have to cut out of my life. And while that might make my life better, it\u2019s hard to let go of the past. \nBlack Pete:\n part of me feels like a fool for lying about my reputation. The other part of me feels like a fool for people not taking my reputation seriously. Some parts of me are real, some are completely fictional, and yet it all makes me sick to my stomach. \nLucius:\n I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing here, and yet this is where I\u2019m at home. My skill sets are completely different than those around me and still I feel welcome. But somehow I feel that I\u2019m not. \nJim:\n the concept of revenge has eaten away at my soul. My upbringing has turned me into the same evil I wished to vanquish and now I feel I am no better than the ones who have hurt me. \nIzzy:\n I don\u2019t care what I have to do to get the recognition I feel I deserve. I feel as I have worked too hard for too long to have my efforts systematically ignored for years and years on end, while other people doing that same work get routinely celebrated.

But I'm going to ramble on now about why it affects me so much, because I keep thinking up these points and not jotting them down. \nSo the context where it's used in the first episode, when Stede is reading to the crew. It sounds a lot like a lullaby, positioning him as their father (along with the fact that he's ... reading a child's story to the crew), for all those found-family feels.\nHe's also dressed in blue and in bluish moonlight which just makes for an excellent image.\nMoondog sounds like some kind of traveling pre-modern singer who travels from village to village, and we all (we are peasants in this scenario) gather around him at the fire at night and listen to him sing his strange stories. This one has an otherworldly edge to it, there is a truth behind it that we can't quite reach.\nThe tune is quite lonely. Stede has always been lonely. He's definitely a lot less lonely with his crew, who are finally on his side at this point in the episode, but he's still alone. He doesn't really have a second-in-command the way (we will find out) that Ed does.\nHe doesn't even know that he has a SOULMATE out there, just waiting for him to come along! He thinks he's about as happy as he'll ever be - away from his marriage and boring life, on a ship with a crew that finally seems to accept him. He doesn't know what we know!!\nThe song itself! Man!\nHigh on a rocky ledge lives a M\u00e4del Edelwei\u00df\nShy as a shadow, lovely as lace, and cold as ice\nHigh on a rocky ledge, I pledge my love to her\nEv'ry time I climb up to Paradise\nHow many times I've been up to see her, goodness knows\nHuffing and puffing, dressed in the warmest climbing clothes\nHow many chances would be taken in my\nHopeless pursuit of the Schnee M\u00e4del Edelwei\u00df\nThen spoke a spirit, \"If you would win your lady love\nThere's only one way: fall to your death from high above\nYou will begin to grow in snow beside the one\nYou have waited for to be mated with\"\nNow, I'm an Edel vice to my M\u00e4del Edelwei\u00df\nDying to be with her wasn't any sacrifice\nWe're so deliriously happy on our ledge\nWhere I pledge my love to my Lady Fair\nYou who are climbing breathless to see me and my love\nSnow flowers growing fonder on Lover's Ledge above\nIf you've the yen to pluck, then pluck us both\nFor we who have lived as one wish to die as one\nSo like it's all about a love that's hopeless on the face of it - a man is in love with a flower. He wants to be with the flower but he's a human and she's a flower so it won't work. Some kind of magical being tells him that if he falls off the mountain, he'll be reincarnated as a flower as well, so he does it and it works. That's \nDARK\n and weird.\nIt parallels himself and Ed, who are born to such extremely different positions that they might as well be a human and a flower.\nIn some ways, Stede is the narrator of the song - he has to die in order to be with the one he loves. This happens multiple times: he's said to have died when he leaves his family to be a pirate (a transformation), he gets stabbed and hanged and nearly dies of the fever as well at the time of his meeting Ed (very liminal), he fakes his own death to be said to have died more truthfully and get closure so that he can be fully with Ed.\nAt the same time, Stede is the flower. Stede loves flowers (and he has been treated like shit his whole life for it); he's picking flowers in the flashback where he's tied to the oars of a rowboat. He is \ndefinitely\n a figure of beauty to Ed, and kind of a damsel in distress - this guy who doesn't know what the hell he's doing as a pirate, who needs to be rescued from himself. (And \"lovely as \nlace\n\", something definitely associated with Stede.)\nAnd that ending: \"If you've the yen to pluck, then pluck us both / For we who have lived as one wish to die as one.\" Hooooooo. A definite parallel to the ending of the season - Ed tying himself to Stede rather than allowing him to be killed."}, {"blog_name": "asgardling", "id": 683619806119870464, "date": "2022-05-07 19:10:51 GMT", "timestamp": 1651950651, "tags": ["im too nervous to check what my art teacher said about it", "why why why", "our flag means death", "ofmd", "blackbonnet", "gentlebeard", "stede bonnet", "edward teach", "ofmdedit", "our flag means death edit", "mine"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z2m-QTbyj9TvCa00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Why on earth did I decide to put my Ed x Stede edit on my art project??

For 1, the fluid love found in ofmd seems more attainable. I can't explain it very well, and even though these two pirates live in this unattainable world for me, their love is completely natural feeling. They love eachother because of who they are. They didn't find eachother attractive as soon as they met, and the show isnt centred around it. It feels natural.\nIn heartstopper, it doesn't feel like I could ever be in a relationship like that. It doesn't happen in british schools, you can't change schools like Elle did, you just can't, and boys schools in britain are so extremely homophobic that even Ben and Charlie's relationship is so wildly unlikely. \nSecond, the fact that OFMD is not centred around being queer. Although it is hugely queer that does not make the show, the events do, and those could happen the same if Stede and Ed were not queer and did not love eachother romantically. However, Heartstopper is surrounding that.

Izzy admires him, otherwise why stick around?\nBut he's not happy, of course - the toxic little man wants more. Just a little more ruthlessness and Ed would be perfect - and maybe even possibly reciprocate feelings back to Izzy in gratitude. He wants to fix Edward, make him fully Blackbeard like some kind of twisted makeover scene from an early 2000s romcom. That's why he's so happy when Ed snaps and grabs him by the throat. Why he's practically incandescent at being fed his own toe and, simultaneously, hearing that Ed killed Lucius (which, yeah, unconfirmed so big fail is likely on that one boss).\nIt's like he's trying to My Fair Lady Ed into being his vision of Blackbeard - all the fuckery and the successful pirating, plus actual murder and maybe, just maybe, loving Izzy back in the balls-to-the-wall fucked up way he wants.\nBut Izzy doesn't know the plot of My Fair Lady. Eliza doesn't stay in the upper class world, no matter how well she managed to fit in. She goes home to where she can be her true self, where she feels comfortable (the upshot of course being that she already knows who she is and where she feels most comfortable when the story begins). Edward is who he is, still, not enough shit has been thrown at him and stuck yet to change that. Decades of pirating, with Izzy no less, and he still has all the soft stuff there, which Stede effortlessly and accidentally brought out just by being his authentic self all over the place. Granted, Ed had also never faced the depth of feeling or level of heartbreak that being with Stede has caused, but Ed's breakdown in the final scene shows there's enough of him left to be brought back. His true self is still in there and wish as he may, try as he might, Izzy won't be able to get rid of it (not unless he finally hits his own breaking point and kills Ed - something I'd be interested to see what it would take)."}, {"blog_name": "smuggsy", "id": 683096016777510912, "date": "2022-05-02 00:25:26 GMT", "timestamp": 1651451126, "tags": ["it's only sensible", "our flag means death", "ofmd", "rambling", "spanish jackie"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zcvavjbws3L3WW00", "note_count": 23, "body": "the widow evelyn higgins and spanish jackie should meet on s2 and rule the caribbean "}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683539972434870272, "date": "2022-05-06 22:01:55 GMT", "timestamp": 1651874515, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbyQ-k_mi00", "note_count": 0, "body": "Head Over Heels\nby \nCloudsPassMeBy\nToday, Izzy wants to help Lucius dress\nWords: 590, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English\nSeries: Part 44 of \nIzzy gets wrecked\nFandoms: \nOur Flag Means Death (TV)\nRating: \nTeen And Up Audiences\nWarnings: \nNo Archive Warnings Apply\nCategories: \nM/M\nCharacters: \nLucius Spriggs\n, \nIsrael Hands\nRelationships: \nIsrael Hands/Lucius Spriggs\nAdditional Tags: \nBody Worship\n, \nSweet\n, \nCuddling\n, \nRomance\n, \nDrabble\n, \nAlternate Universe - Modern Setting\n, \nLingerie\n, \nKneeling\n\nsource \nhttps://archiveofourown.org/works/38830866"}, {"blog_name": "purplespacecats", "id": 683017757950967808, "date": "2022-05-01 03:41:33 GMT", "timestamp": 1651376493, "tags": ["ofmd", "i mean obv we have no shortage of foreground canon queers in this lovely show", "but why not also make those two fanon ocs just for funsies?!"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z4_cPxbwaGWryu00", "note_count": 4, "body": "tbh i'm surprised i haven't seen any fanworks about blackbeard's silent background leather daddies lmao"}, {"blog_name": "galexibrain", "id": 683706680489492480, "date": "2022-05-08 18:11:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1652033501, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZoKoqubz0vfz8q00", "note_count": 8, "body": "Ed:\n *cuts off Izzy's pinky and feeds it to him* And if you ever threaten me again I'll feed you the rest of them\nIzzy:\n Is that a promise? \ud83e\udd7a"}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683162493118496768, "date": "2022-05-02 18:02:03 GMT", "timestamp": 1651514523, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5Sbx5Ah_Ci00", "note_count": 0, "body": "We have no choice\nby \nrandomisedmongoose\nWe know why Stede went to sea.

You can\u2019t tell me this is a world without homophobia, because it\u2019s not. \nBut the relationship is inherently more complicated. \u201cGod knows Blackie and I have had our dalliances.\u201d Right there, without a clear top/bottom dynamic like we like to see\u2014like we like for clarity about who\u2019s a \u201creal\u201d man and who isn\u2019t. \nSo what\u2019s the deal? Where do we leave role, top v bottom, behind? Where does love fit into all of this?\nI don\u2019t know. But after I finish my current vid I might try to find out.

I feel like he's written as Bipolar coded, and exhibits symptoms consistent with the disorder. If we look at his actions being informed through this lens, I feel a lot of his behavior/actions/relationships make more sense.\nFull disclaimer, I am only speaking from my own lived experiences dealing with diagnosed Bipolar I. I am not a medical professional. Bipolar disorder is defined as a severe mood disorder where the person who has it cycles through intense episodes of (hypo)mania and depression (high highs and low lows). It manifests itself differently from person to person.\nManic episodes can last anywhere between a week to months. OFMD takes place in the span of a few weeks. This timeline checks out with the theory of Bipolar, because Edward \"crashes\" in episode 10. He went from a high high of impulsively wanting to run away with Stede, to a low low of becoming the Kraken. While, yes, heartbreak & betrayal are factors here, I don't believe they're solely to blame. They merely helped trigger (along with Izzy) the sudden drop to depression. In a sense, episode 10 is a climax to what we know of Edward: that he reacts disproportionately to things due to his emotional dysregulation.\nWhen we meet Edward in episode 4, he's \"bored out of his skull\" with \"increasingly erratic moods\" whose crew has been worried about his judgement.  We get a glimpse of this erratic behavior when he and Izzy are going through Stede's trinkets. At first, Edward seems fine, having a good laugh about the trinkets, yet when Izzy tells him he needs to focus, to plan, it triggers Edward to whiplash right into irritableness.  \nThe suicidal ideation that comes next is masked as a threat. It is a power play to Izzy. A \"fuck around and find out\" in the most manipulative way. Edward's reaction is completely disproportionate to Izzy's request for him to focus, though. He's hot and he's cold on a dime. \nAnother thing to point out here, is that Edward is easily distracted by unrelated/unimportant things (i.e. the trinkets). This feeds into his hyperfixations. He has a lack of concentration too.\nYet another example of a disproportionate emotional response in episode 4 is when Izzy corrects him that it's not the date Edward believes it to be. Instead of figuring out an alternative plan, Edward immediately feels hopeless enough to give up and go get drunk. \"Captain goes down with the ship\". This seriously concerns Izzy, breaks the camel's back, because not even six hours beforehand, Edward had threatened suicide. And Edward's resigned to the outlook of death until the lighthouse plan works, then suddenly he's back to seemingly wanting to live again. It's whiplash after whiplash.\nIzzy called him a \"shell of a man\", which is an assessment that Edward agrees with. Oftentimes while manic \u2014 and I have felt this too \u2014 people lose their sense of identity. All that's left is a shell of who you used to be pre-episode, and depending on the severity of the episode, that person can be unrecognizable. The loss of identity coincides heavily with Edward's character arc, as he tries to reinvent himself out of Blackbeard and into Ed.  \nAnother way to read this reinvention is through the idea that Edward \"quits his job\" impulsively out of the boredom he feels. He \"works for\" Blackbeard. He used to love working for Blackbeard, used to be high-functioning at his job, too. To suddenly want to quit and retire? That's wild. That rightfully sets off alarm bells in other characters (namely Izzy). \nImpulsivity is another symptom of mania. Edward is shown repeatedly to be impulsive throughout the season. The biggest example is his plan to sail with Stede to China in episode 9. He's euphoric in this scene, happier than we've ever seen him. The euphoria doesn't last. I don't believe it would've lasted even if Stede had met him on the docks, based on the prior knowledge that his boredom eventually comes back.\n(Quick note about the docks: it's a fantastic scene to analyze, because Edward doesn't go looking for Stede. He's in his head the entire time he's waiting for him.)\nBoredom is commonly present in Bipolar manic episodes. Feelings of restlessness often occur and Edward exhibits them to a T. He distracts himself from this by hyperfixating on Stede and Stede's way of doing things, and it works until episode 7. Edward is once again bored, saying he \"can't stay around here forever\" and that he \"wasn't built for sitting idle\".\nWhen manic, interpersonal relationships become tumultuous. You can see this clearly displayed through his codependent relationship with Izzy, and then again in episode 10 with the rest of the Revenge crew. \nHis relationship with Stede is no different. He places Stede on a pedestal of sorts (\"I suppose what makes Ed happy is...you\"). He's got the rose colored glasses on to the point where he doesn't even see Stede for what he is: a deeply flawed man. Then when Stede hurts him for the first time, he whiplashes and devalues him completely.\nEpisode 10 is the inevitable crash of depression after mania. In my experience, the higher the highs, the lower the lows. We see Edward isolated in his room for days, captain's quarters a mess. He's singing about hanging on by a thread. His suicidal ideation is back. He's out of it and vulnerable. My man is not doing so hot. \nBut then his mood swings yet again by getting the impulsive idea to throw a talent show. He even begins to clean his room. And Izzy? Izzy's had enough of his erratic behavior. \nKeep in mind, at the beginning of episode 4, Izzy's stressed to his limit already with Edward and his moods. It's not easy navigating life with someone who has untreated bipolar, it's very very difficult. Izzy is an angry little man, and he is a right freak, but he's loyal to a terrible fault. This entire season, he's trying to protect Edward from himself. The man he loves is on a mental health decline and he isn't equipped to deal with it. He can't blame Edward, so he thinks it's Stede's fault (\"done something to my boss' brain\"). \nIzzy allows Edward space and privacy to grieve Stede without much flack. He even covers for him, but he's clearly strained by it. When Edward goes public with his depression and says \"Why are we even pirates?\", it's a slap in the face to the \"support\" Izzy's shown him thus far. It reaffirms that no, Edward is not well. Edward is, in Izzy's mind, worse.\nIzzy, having had enough of this and wanting to go back to the way things were pre-manic episode, triggers Edward into violence. He is a direct cause of Edward going back to black and embracing the Kraken. In fact, it's safe to say that Izzy himself is a massive trigger for Edward. \nThe Kraken is a coping mechanism for Edward's severe depression and heartbreak. It is an extreme the same way the persona of Ed is an extreme. Where Ed is open and warm and soft, the Kraken is cold and violent and closed off. He abuses alcohol while in this persona, as alluded to by him drinking from a bottle of rum he carries around on deck. People with Bipolar have a higher rate of substance abuse/addiction. This behavior checks out.\nAnd that's where the season ends.\nAgain, this reading of Edward is just a theory I've been chewing on. I'm sure there are more examples I haven't gone into, but I hope what I have makes sense"}, {"blog_name": "darkshrimpemotions", "id": 683380688142090240, "date": "2022-05-05 03:50:10 GMT", "timestamp": 1651722610, "tags": ["ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZOhPXxbxsnrx4a00", "note_count": 3, "body": "I LOVE YOU LUCIUS"}, {"blog_name": "swansstuff", "id": 683153293947682816, "date": "2022-05-02 15:35:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1651505750, "tags": ["ofmd", "swan speaks", "its all very cool and dramatic but alas", "only my thoughts will see it"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZyaJ9abx34qauy00", "note_count": 1, "body": "I have a perfect play-by-play of a holding out for a hero ofmd animatic, if only I was skilled enough to execute it lmao"}, {"blog_name": "jonwatson", "id": 683798734148173824, "date": "2022-05-09 18:34:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1652121290, "tags": ["renew it.
