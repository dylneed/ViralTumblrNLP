These proto-Magyars, Dracula claims, are \nthe blood that begot the legends of \nberserkir\n and werewolves. (In\n reality, the berserker myth is characteristic of North Germanic peoples\n which Stoker seems to have confused with Northern Finno-Ugric groups \nlike the Finns.)\nDracula:\n \"Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the\n Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and \nWodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent, \nwhich their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of\n Europe, aye, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that \nthe werewolves themselves had come.\"\nStoker's Source\n(s)\n:\n\n \"...Max M\u00fcller, by the unerring guide of language, has traced the \noriginal seat of this interesting people [the Magyars] to the Ural \nmountains which stretch upwards to the Arctic ocean; and pointing out \nthe close affinity the Magyar tongue bears to the idiom of the Finnish \nrace spoken east of the Volga, declares that the Magyars form the fourth\n branch of the Finnish stock, viz. the Ugric; and in his 'Science of \nLanguage' he gives striking examples of the similarity and connection \nwhich exist in the grammatical structure of the Magyar and the \nUgro-Finnish dialects, particularly in the conjugation of verbs, which \nhave aptly been called the \"bones and sinews\" of a language; and there \nis little doubt that the Magyars are none other than the same race that,\n under a different name, were called in the fourth century \"Ugrogs.\" \n(Nina Mazuchelli's \nMaygarland\n, Chapter IV, pg. 45)\n335 B.C.E.:\n The Get\u00e6 tribe of the Carpathian basin is defeated\n by Alexander the Great, which E.

In 376 A.D. the Huns \npaid Dacia a 'morning call,' and subdued it, driving out the Goths. \nThese fierce Scythians are not flatteringly described by Gibbon, to \nwhose delightful pages I must refer my readers for details of their \npersonal appearance, &c.\u201d \n(E.

There are so many gems coming up and I can\u2019t wait for folks to be introduced.\nWould anyone here who has already read Dracula be interested in doing a readalong sometime of Powers of Darkness: the lost version of Dracula? This has been on my list since it came out in English in 2016 and I finally got a physical copy of it on indie bookstore day.\nIt\u2019s honestly wild that Powers of Darkness exists. It was \nsupposed to\n\u00a0be a Swedish translation published in serial. However, the anonymous translator just straight up added chapters, changed significant plot elements, moved things around, and did whatever they liked. After the serial was published in Swedish, it was released as a novel in Icelandic the following year.\nThe Icelandic novel was thought to be just an abridged translation for the longest time because back in the 1890s you could just get away with shit. If you acted confident no one would check you.\nAnyway, you don\u2019t have to answer now. I just think it would be fun to talk about Powers of Darkness with folks after they\u2019ve read the original novel.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "mespotato", "id": 683413147699363840, "date": "2022-05-05 12:26:06 GMT", "timestamp": 1651753566, "tags": ["dracula", "dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zk5NISbx_ACFSy00", "note_count": 0, "body": "thank you dear, dear tumblr for introducing me to Dracula Daily. now I'm not gonna shut up about it.

It was a beautiful black hardcover book with a dramatic illustration of a red eyed Dracula on top of the title. I said I would take care of it and then, tragically, only got a few chapters in before my cat locked eyes with it at night, threw it from my nightstand  and munched and ripped two chapters to shreds while I somehow slept through it all. I felt like the kid that truthfully has to say their dog ate their homework, but thankfully my sister was very understanding of our cat's midnight lunacy. It wasn't her favourite book or anything, but she was sad about it because it was a very cool copy. In the end, with time we both promptly forgot about it all. \nFastforward some years later, I am at a bookshop and I see this beautiful clothbound Dracula copy, hardcover with a black castle and iridiscent blue details. The memory of my sister's shredded copy rushes back to me and I decide, yeah why not, I'll buy this one, read it once and for all, and then gift it back to her. \nThat was last week, on May 1st, imagine my surprise when I opened tumblr three days later and found everyone going bananas about reading this same 1897 book via emails. Anyways, whether you found it from the hilarious real-time chronological chain of emails that is dracula daily or have been delayed from reading it by a paper-eating feline rage, fate has indeed brought us all together to read Bram Stoker's Dracula in 2022. I'm okay with that.

It always throws me that the above quotation has Jonathan taking photos with a camera and showing them to Dracula. It just messes with me because I think of that as such an old book, set far in the past. It messes with me that cars were a thing in the world of Dracula. I think of it as such a chronologically ancient book that might be from the middle ages or something like that. The fact that I knew people in my childhood who were born only five years after the events of this book take place is so mystifying to me.\ufffc\ufffc\nFor a literary anthology, I wrote a story (which was rejected) about a vampire in the wild West and I needed the townsfolk to know what a vampire was. The fact that the very first major book in the West (outside of Eastern Europe) that talked about vampires was this one from 1897, after the wild West was over made it very difficult. I needed to choose one of the first vampire books by John Polidori from the beginning of the 1800s as a way to introduce the concept of the vampire to a bunch of random locals in a town in the west.

There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to medi\u00e6val times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\"\nSay what you will about Dracula, but you can't say he doesn't have good taste in real estate.

He\u2019s too old and powerful to not have at least some idea of what the English are like, plus he can absolutely pick up an idea of what they\u2019re like and what they think of foreign cultures from the books he\u2019s been reading (if he actually has been). What he\u2019s doing here feels like he\u2019s appealing to Jon\u2019s national pride and innate sense of superiority for being English in order to lull him further into a false sense of security. He\u2019s playing on that idea of \u201cthe white man\u2019s burden,\u201d the belief that white English folk have to set an example for the people they consider beneath them, in order to further persuade Jon that the peasants were wrong and just superstitious. \nAnd once again I think it\u2019s interesting to realize that the narrative ends up framing Jon as being wrong for listening to that biased belief and going against whatever doubts he might have. While we shouldn\u2019t ignore the bigotries that the book perpetuated, cultural hindsight and the knowledge of who Dracula is affords us the opportunity to read this as a sort of cautionary tale. It comes across as a warning that ignoring the red flags and trusting your biases over the knowledge of more experienced (but formally uneducated) people will put you in danger.

It seems to be about equivalent to a Duke/Duchess role, being second only to the ruling family.\nHere, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come.\nThe best guess I have at what the Count is referencing here is the general habit of Norse people, during the Viking age (~800s-1100s), of sailing down rivers to raid places. We know that by following the Volga down south Vikings reached the Black Sea, as far south as Constantinople (then capital of the Byzantine Empire), because we have records of Norse men serving as warriors in the \nVarangian guard\n. The \nKievan Rus\n were also active in Eastern Europe around the same time, pretty much through the extent of the Viking age, although I believe it's still debated whether they count as 'Vikings'. \nNo idea why he specifies that they came from Iceland. While in the Icelandic sagas, heroes taking a break to go off east and do some raiding abroad is somewhat common, it's far more likely that anyone attacking Eastern Europe would be from Sweden, Norway, or Denmark (possibly also Finland, although with how borders were different back then and how Finns are referenced in Icelandic sagas, my main reference, I have no idea where the Finnish factor into things here). \nEDIT: Wodin is of course Odin; the W- spelling (Wodin or Woden) is more commonly found in Old English sources.\n...they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert.\nThis is a complicated sentence full of commas, as literature of this period will do. I think Drac is saying the people being conquered by the Huns thought the Huns were descended from witches and devils, which, sure, why not. We've already had plenty of weird otherizing descriptions of other ethnicities. \nAttila the Hun ruled during the mid 400s, which means Drac is correct that the Huns were there long before the Vikings. No comments on the historical veracity of witches being expelled from Scythia.\nArpad\n is a historical person whose life seems to be hotly debated. Whatever the case, Dracula's assertion that he is Hungary's founder appears to agree with Hungarian sentiment (Hungarians, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not really going farther than Wikipedia because I'm just having fun with this). \"Honfoglalas\" seems to be the Hungarian word for \"the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian basin\", aka, the military action the Count is describing when he mentions Arpad.\nand to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land\nI mentioned the Byzantine Empire earlier, and I'm going to take a stab that, since we're talking about medieval history still (9th century ish), Turkey-land is a reference to this Empire, since Constantinople, the imperial capital, was right at the gate between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and the Byzantines were largely occupying Greece and Turkey at this time. \nThis link (\nX\n) is the only reference I could find with a quick search as to \"the shame of Cassova\". It seems that Cassova is a misspelled 'Kosovo'. As for the rest of this:\nWhen was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed!\n'Voivode' seems to be a military/nobility title akin to a general, or more like a medieval lord leading his feudal serfs to battle. \nDrac's references to this noble Dracula who was betrayed by a brother seem to be references to the actual historical Vlad Dracul, aka the Impaler. I can't tell if it's just hard to do good research while eating breakfast and not giving it 100% of my attention, or if the problem is Stoker just saying whatever he wanted, but luckily I'm not the first person to write about \nthe Dracula-irl Dracula links\n. \nAs a reminder, while I'm doing all this linking to Wikipedia and other non-academic sources, always fact check your research against other sources and make sure it's verifiable. Don't trust random people on the internet. If I were writing a thesis paper this would be completely unacceptable levels of research dedication. Luckily I am also a random person on the internet. \nWe leave off with Jonathan referencing Arabian Nights, a rather famous story. In it, a woman, Scheherezade, is married to a king who kills his brides every morning after the day he marries them, so she tells him stories that end on a huge cliffhanger each dawn and refuses to continue until the next night. That way, he's too invested to kill her that day, and she has at least 12 more hours of being alive (and to think up an ending, and a new story to cliffhanger).

No jump-scares, obviously, but a growing sense of dread as you figure out what\u2019s going on only a couple of steps before the characters do, hoping desperately that they can catch up to you. \nAnd it is a thoroughly Christian novel. Dracula\u2019s behavior is drawn heavily from Christian ideas of the mechanisms of sin, while the heroes combat their deathly enemy not only with Christian symbols, but with the three Christian theological virtues of faith, hope, and love.\nThere will be art, and maybe some literary analysis.

This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder.\nHere's a question: why is Dracula sneaking up on Jonathan in his bedroom first thing in the \nmorning\n evening?\nPretty sure he's been all politeness before, at least enough to knock. Is this a case of his getting tired of keeping up the pretense (he's still making beds and stuff later so that's iffy), or is he just having so much fun with Jonathan's obvious nervousness that he wants to have fun jump-scaring him?\nIt would be so funny if he saw the mirror and deliberately moved where he should've been reflected, as a kind of fun little prank, only to get startled into bloodlust when Jonathan cut himself.

While my name may be based in the realm of cosmic horror, my first love in the genre has always been the Gothic vampire story, so I'm super excited to see all this Dracula daily stuff going around.\nI thought I'd take a moment to recommend one of my favorite vampire books, and favorite books in general. \nThe Thief of Always by Clive Barker is a modern vampire story with a rather non-traditional take on the vampire as a monster. The short novel is targeted at all audiences, I first read it around 9 or 10, and 15 years later I still enjoy re-reading it. \nIt does, to me, feel like a Gothic novel as far as narrative structure is concerned. It deals with the childhood wish for adult freedom, self discovery and expression, dealing with grief, loss, and regret, and love and human connection. All in all, it's a wonderful book that I think all fans of horror and the vampire should read at some point in their lives and that everyone can take something away from, and I feel like I don't see it referenced enough. \nIf you get the chance, I hope you give it a read, and I hope you like it as much as I do.\nAlso, if you try to tell me Mr. Hood isn\u2019t a vampire, I will fight you, and I will write an essay on why you are wrong."}, {"blog_name": "grumpytrans", "id": 683646404099457024, "date": "2022-05-08 02:13:37 GMT", "timestamp": 1651976017, "tags": ["yet again vampires are popular", "vampires", "vampire", "dracula", "dracula daily", "reading", "book", "books", "bram stocker's dracula", "bram stoker", "occult", "read", "victorian", "me", "mine", "classic literature"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zru8DvbypCXCKa00", "note_count": 34, "body": "i cannot believe that i get to experience the Draculapocalypse and pretend that im some fancy victorian lady fainting on her couch after reading the book for the first time"}, {"blog_name": "beforusnepeta", "id": 683601305778962432, "date": "2022-05-07 14:16:47 GMT", "timestamp": 1651933007, "tags": ["dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zyk-isbyeyG6yi00", "note_count": 1, "body": "jonathan is okay! he simply had a nice date day in with the count at his home library\ngood for them :)"}, {"blog_name": "onyourwhereabouts", "id": 683501670625427456, "date": "2022-05-06 11:53:08 GMT", "timestamp": 1651837988, "tags": ["dracula", "dracula daily", "jonathan harker", "anna.txt"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZvKFjebyIINf0y00", "note_count": 44, "body": "dracula and his three vampire girlfriends approach jonathan harker in a dimly lit bar and tell him they really like his vibe"}, {"blog_name": "arachne-is-hela-cool", "id": 683614096400252928, "date": "2022-05-07 17:40:06 GMT", "timestamp": 1651945206, "tags": ["dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZKtTFfbyhsOJOm00", "note_count": 2, "body": "I forgot how much mr stoker loves the word voluptuous "}, {"blog_name": "despereauxmouse", "id": 683607608910856192, "date": "2022-05-07 15:56:59 GMT", "timestamp": 1651939019, "tags": ["dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0eKpobygN_Mui00", "note_count": 0, "body": "be honest how many of you are kinning jonathan harker. its ok you can tell me i wont judge"}, {"blog_name": "taliadoesrpgs", "id": 683694583326146560, "date": "2022-05-08 14:59:24 GMT", "timestamp": 1652021964, "tags": ["dracula daily", "here for jonathan harker being the only character who doesn't realize he's in Dracula", "romanian paprika is spicy as hell - reblog to save a life"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zx4bGUby_9dc0u00", "note_count": 24, "body": "What my good friend Jonathan Harker sent in his letter:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCount Dracula is playing at being his own servants!\u201d\nWhat I immediately imagined: \nCount Dracula in a maid costume"}, {"blog_name": "emungere", "id": 683605464149377024, "date": "2022-05-07 15:22:53 GMT", "timestamp": 1651936973, "tags": ["dracula daily", "and he thought this would be suitable", "dude you KNEW", "you knew picking out that suitable house that something was not right", "the most unfortunate way to pass a vibe check", "i have read this before and missed so much hilarity"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZyRiwwbyfumv8y00", "note_count": 32, "body": "so to recap the house in London that our good friend jh picked out for Dracula: \n- gloomy, dark, crumbling to ruins\n- deep spooky pond\n- barred windows\n- next door to a lunatic asylum (but it\u2019s okay! you can\u2019t see it from the house at all!!)

I was a little worried that I\u2019d be the only one who actually has any interest in that sort of thing, but I guess I\u2019m very wrong lol\nAnyway, so here\u2019s a basic outline of what I\u2019ve got so far. If anyone wants to run with this and write their own fanfics or something, go ahead, just tag me so that I can read the hell out of it\n Blackbeard as Dracula because if you really think about it, their characters are EXTREMELY similar. In some of the more humanizing moments, Dracula laments that even if he knows how to speak English, that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019d actually fit in London, and that he\u2019d still stick out like a sore thumb. Pretty much exactly like Blackbeard\u2019s desire to fit in with the nobles in episode 5. Dracula isn\u2019t even a name, it\u2019s an epithet, and so you bet your ass I\u2019m gonna run with the parallels to the Blackbeard title\n Stede as Jonathan because they\u2019re both chronic dumbasses who have no idea what they\u2019re doing and completely disregard the red flags that everyone around them have been begging them to look at. Also because it is my firm belief that Jonathan and Dracula should have kissed. \n Mary as Mina. I love Mina Harker and don\u2019t want to just dismiss her as \u201cthe female love interest\u201d, and I think that Jonathan and Mina have a very sweet relationship, but in a theoretical Dracula AU fit, Mary makes the most sense as \u201cwoman who doesn\u2019t hear from her fianc\u00e9 for months before he finally gets found in a hospital in Budapest with PTSD\u201d. If I do end up writing a full fan fiction, I\u2019ll try to make sure that she isn\u2019t just an obstacle to Blackstede and that she gets to have the cool moments that Mina has in the book\n Lucius as Lucy because they\u2019re both polyamorous and they both get killed/almost killed by Dracula/Blackbeard. Also, someone on discord pointed out that their names are basically the same already\nJim as Van Helsing because the prospect of Jim as a vampire hunter who acts first and then explains nothing until the very last minute is perfect to me. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure Van Helsing\u2019s wife was killed by vampires, and that could easily translate into Jim having their family killed by vampires as a motivation.\n Oluwande as John Seward. This is something I still need to work on a bit since a large part of Seward\u2019s character is that he\u2019s in love with Lucy, but besides that, Seward is one of the few characters who actually has brain cells, and he\u2019s also paired up with Van Helsing for most of the novel and since Jim is already filling that role, it makes sense to have Olu as their sidekick. \n Black Pete as Arthur Holmwood just because he\u2019s dating Lucius in the show and Arthur is boring enough that it\u2019s very easy to copy and paste Black Pete in his place. \n Dracula\u2019s wives are Izzy, Ivan, and Fang, just because that\u2019s Blackbeard\u2019s crew. The wives aren\u2019t really developed in the book so it\u2019s very easy to just throw them in. I am also incredibly amused by the prospect of Izzy being Blackbeard\u2019s malewife and getting scolded for almost eating Stede\n Buttons is Mr. Swales and I will not be taking any questions at this time. I\u2019m correct.\nThat\u2019s everything I have so far. I\u2019m still trying to figure out who to cast as Quincey Morris, the third of Lucy\u2019s suitors and resident cowboy. I\u2019m tempted to throw in Calico Jack purely because of the cowboy vibes he gives off, but it doesn\u2019t make much sense besides that. \nI do have an idea of what the story would look like, and I\u2019m VERY excited because it\u2019s surprisingly easy to tweak the story of Dracula to fit OFMD, but I don\u2019t want to throw all of my ideas out here since I\u2019m genuinely interested in seeing other people\u2019s ideas of what this AU might look like"}, {"blog_name": "imindhowwelayinjune", "id": 683706507958878208, "date": "2022-05-08 18:08:56 GMT", "timestamp": 1652033336, "tags": ["dracula", "dracula daily", "loving this experience", "he really is painfully British"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPH_Qpbz0t9HWm00", "note_count": 8, "body": "Johnny Harks: Realizes his host does not appear in mirrors, watches his host turn 'demoniac' at the sight of his blood, is told by his host EXPLICITLY that Bleeding In This Country Is Dangerous, a totally normal thing to say, realizes further that he is likely alone in this place\nJ Harks: how annoying \ud83d\ude15"}, {"blog_name": "darrengrave", "id": 683603421482385408, "date": "2022-05-07 14:50:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1651935025, "tags": ["dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZYFk2nbyfR2Wim00", "note_count": 30, "body": "I hope frankenstein gets the dracula daily treatment"}, {"blog_name": "iamtrappedinsideasnowglobe", "id": 683511636219346944, "date": "2022-05-06 14:31:32 GMT", "timestamp": 1651847492, "tags": ["dracula daily", ":)", "its not what you think i prommy"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZnH78ibyKZOqiq00", "note_count": 6, "body": "Waiting for everyone to get to the part of dracula where they use the word sperm"}, {"blog_name": "oswincha0tic", "id": 683577836385255424, "date": "2022-05-07 08:03:45 GMT", "timestamp": 1651910625, "tags": ["dracula daily", "bram stoker's dracula", "PSA for the bookclub", "i joined because it's been over a decade since I last read it", "also ya'll aren't prepared for what happens", "wait till ya'll meet renfield"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0zVHWbyZckY4i00", "note_count": 5, "body": "If I recall correctly, there should be a new post on Dracula Daily today.\nI\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a May 7th entry.\nlike 99% sure"}, {"blog_name": "theladyandtheunicorn", "id": 683609861932679168, "date": "2022-05-07 16:32:47 GMT", "timestamp": 1651941167, "tags": ["dracula daily", "dracula", "if you have Dracula Thoughts feel free to share them with me!"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZMq8ZSbygumfSu00", "note_count": 159, "body": "So I took a class last year where one of the books we read was Dracula, and if you\u2019re interested in analyzing the novel, here\u2019s some themes we discussed:\n- the fear of sex, and especially sexual deviancy - consider vampirism as a metaphor for sex (which is sometimes very explicit!), and consider the relationships between the characters\n- modernity vs tradition: what is the place of traditions in the modern world? Can modern trappings truly eliminate the relevance of tradition and superstition? The English like to think of themselves as superior to regions and people with less industrialization and more superstition - how does this influence their problem solving?\n- what it means to be Manly, and whether or not an Englishman of 1897, with all of his perceived civilization and culture, could embody that trait (contrast with Dracula (Romania) and Quincey (Texas))\n- racism! antiromanism! do I even need to elaborate because it\u2019s really obvious already!\n- sexism!

They're will o' the wisp, most probably, and serve to mark the road to the castle for Dracula during this one night in which it's possible for him to traverse the barrier between the living and the dead with a full on coach with an actual living person on it (did you think it was a coincidence that Harker was scheduled to arrive specifically *that night*?). The coachman was Dracula himself and the one hour round trip he forced poor Harker to take was about going across some sort of barrier that surrounds his castle without arousing *too much* suspicion. Like he could've easily idk bewitched Jonathan and dragged him back to the castle as prey but he *really really* wants all of his documents about his trip to England to be in order and he needs a British lawyer in full possession of his abilities to do that.

He's calmed down by the power of vicarious Christianity, and I still think Bram Stoker can't tell a rosary from a crucifix necklace. Despite this little incident and feeling increasingly unsettled by Dracula's presence (and annoyed because the latter broke his shaving glass - priorities, man! Get them!), Jonathan is miffed that he's left alone for a meal, and then \nvery\n unsettled when he finds he can't leave the castle because Dracula is developing Overly Attached Boyfriend syndrome. \nI'm pleasantly surprised that it actually \nis\n Dracula playing servant, making Jonathan's bed and whatnot; we know there are ladies in this house and it's the 1890s, so I appreciate a man who'll willingly do chores. Jonathan tries to be subtle and suave when talking to Dracula. Amazingly, it works; Dracula gets into a rant about his family history which reads like Stoker is being contemptuous of other cultures and ethnicities again. Trying to make Dracula look snooty because he looks down on \"peasants\" is kinda rich tho when compared with Jonathan's attitude during the first chapters. Stoker is also trying to namedrop every ethnic group and noble family he knows, plus literary references to 1001 nights and Hamlet, so we can rest assured he's well-educated. Not buying it; that history bit smells fishy. \nWonder if Jonathan's casual attitude is healthy. He's like, \"yeah, I realized I'm being held prisoner, talked a bit to my captor, then went to bed (to enjoy queer dreams)\".

Stronger, too, I\u2019d wager.\nHowever, Hungarian paprikas \nvary\n \nin how\n \nhot they are\n, \nas well as \nother flavor profile qualities, depending on the variety. \nThe two main types, per the sources I found, are Hot (csip\u0151s) and Sweet (\u00e9des). \nThe sweet paprika is not actually sweet, especially to an American palate, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s called in English. \n\n\n\u00a0In the US, both are available in grocery stores as Hot and Sweet Hungarian paprika, respectively. I have a tin of Pride of Szeged sweet paprika in my spice cabinet. \nPer the same sources, the type of Hungarian paprika used for paprika hendl (chicken paprikash) is the sweet. \nSo the Hungarian sweet paprika used in chicken hendl is hotter and more complexly flavored than what you\u2019re used to if you\u2019re used to generic paprika. \nAnd it\u2019s definitely hotter and more complex than 1890s Englishman Jonathan Harker would have been used to, or even really familiar with.\nAnd, of course, the question of what the Hungarian sweet paprika used in that area of Transylvania in the 1890s would have tasted like in comparison with the Hungarian sweet paprika available today (both in and out of Hungary) is another question, and one that I cannot speak to at all. \n\u00a0But if you use Hungarian sweet paprika regularly, as I do, and/or have eaten or cooked chicken paprikash, and were confused by references in tumblr posts to the use of hot paprika to make it, there\u2019s your answer.\n(I only linked each source once, though each spoke to everything that I mentioned.)"}, {"blog_name": "rriverrgrace", "id": 683544587097292800, "date": "2022-05-06 23:15:16 GMT", "timestamp":

That\u2019s real, it happened, and it\u2019s been haunting me ever since.\n Everyone thinks of Dracula as a spooky vampire man, and he is, but he\u2019s also the physical embodiment of mansplain, manipulate, malewife and the fact that all three of those descriptors can be supported with textual evidence is both amusing and distressing to me\n Quincey Morris has the funniest proposal speech ever and I take every opportunity to quote it\n Everything Van Helsing ever says is insane and I need y\u2019all to know that before you think that he\u2019s some badass vampire hunter. He is, but he also refuses to explain anything to anyone ever\n Also, Seward and Van Helsing find a kid in the middle of the night while doing vampire business and instead of handing them over to the authorities, since that would require them to explain what they were doing and how they found a child in the middle of the night, they wait until they see a police officer approaching and then leave the kid in the middle of the sidewalk for the officer to see. I can\u2019t believe that this happens in a scary gothic horror novel \n While discussing vampire business, Quincey just kinda\u2026 gets up and leaves, and then suddenly everyone hears a gunshot and they look out to see Quincey who was like \u201cyeah I saw a bat, I\u2019ve just been shooting any bat I see nowadays\u201d. \n Quincey is generally just the best character ever because his one personality trait is Texas. And I know that because if you\u2019re like me and read Bram Stoker\u2019s notes, he\u2019s literally just referred to as The Texan for a while. \nAnyway, all of that is just off the top of my head, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll think of more later. I just wanted to build some hype so that people actually read this book "}, {"blog_name": "curiousmorbidity", "id": 683676781427949568, "date": "2022-05-08 10:16:27 GMT", "timestamp": 1652004987, "tags": ["every time queer or gay is said in these emails I am willfully choosing to ignore their intended and original definitions", "dracula daily", "insane girl tag"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zt7Gqfbyw6aICW00", "note_count": 15, "body": "When you are young and gay so you seek the gaiety and mirth and the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which all pleases you\n(because you are young and gay)"}, {"blog_name": "themermaidavenger", "id": 683572885918531584, "date": "2022-05-07 06:45:04 GMT", "timestamp": 1651905904, "tags": ["dracula daily", "my raised Catholic ass will not let this go"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZTA4djbyYUi3Gq00", "note_count": 1, "body": "of course an Anglican has to make a side comment dissing crucifixes when the townspeople are only trying to help"}, {"blog_name": "oh-jesus-in-the-air", "id": 683700244659257344, "date": "2022-05-08 16:29:23 GMT", "timestamp": 1652027363, "tags": ["dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZNi3Pbby-S07mq00", "note_count": 8, "body": "\"He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts.\"\nGlad Jonathon isn't gonna let Dracula gaslight him."}, {"blog_name": "peachygos", "id": 683411692511805440, "date": "2022-05-05 12:02:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1651752178, "tags": ["dracula daily", "misc"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z5Sk5Ybxzr0-Wy00", "note_count": 11, "body": "jonathan my good friend jonathan i am so eager to hear from you today"}, {"blog_name": "kaviiinsky", "id": 683607830039805952, "date": "2022-05-07 16:00:29 GMT", "timestamp": 1651939229, "tags": ["it doesn\u2019t have to be dated journals like Dracula but just a serialized story delivered via inbox :)", "dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZwSbmpbygRCJCi00", "note_count": 13, "body": "I want to do more books like this, can we do Frankenstein next "}, {"blog_name": "dathen", "id": 683599413241888768, "date": "2022-05-07 13:46:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1651931203, "tags": ["dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZNeFhibyeWjYyi00", "note_count": 3034, "body": "Turns out the reason we didn\u2019t hear from our good friend Jonathan yesterday was because Dracula has Can\u2019t Shut Up Disease and Jonathan is all \u201cwell it\u2019s 4 a.m. but it would be \nrude\n to interrupt and say I should go to bed so I guess I will sit here indefinitely\u201d"}, {"blog_name": "lezbianz", "id": 683606075944108032, "date": "2022-05-07 15:32:37 GMT", "timestamp": 1651937557, "tags": ["my post", "dracula daily", "idk why it\u2019s hilarious to me"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZUHS_Ybyg1ggye00", "note_count": 50, "body": "okay the funniest thing about reading dracula for the first time is finding out that jonathan harker is a fucking real estate agent. like he\u2019s staying in some creepy castle with the literal count dracula for \nwork\n? to sell him some \nproperty\n????"}, {"blog_name": "cinemaocd", "id": 683430350110818304, "date": "2022-05-05 16:59:31 GMT", "timestamp": 1651769971, "tags": ["I made goulash last week-end and I had leftovers for breakfast today and I can tell you I vibe with this guy already", "dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZnV5Nyby24XF4u00", "note_count": 21, "body": "OK, I love this book already...Some novels have great opening sentences.

Fandom isn't created by exclusivity, it's created by everyone being on the same part of the story together and the feeling of journeying through it. I mean, the book is in the public domain and just about every library, you could easily get it and read ahead. But there's a sense of community in reading about Jonathan Harker reaching the castle and then coming on here to see people talking about that very thing.\nWhen you sell early access to media, it creates a desynchronization within the community. People who buy early access can't talk about it for fear of posting spoilers, and people who don't can't go into those spaces for fear of seeing spoilers. Even if you use the appropriate tags and blacklist the appropriate spoilers, it creates a fission in the fandom. The theory someone posted about the newest episode is already outdated by 10 episodes. That amazing artist's fanart is completely inaccessible until you either wait out the public release or cave and shell out. At best, it leads to confusion and frustration (as with many iQiyi shows as they approach the finale). At worst, it leads to a complete desiccation of an exhausted community (as with Choices)."}, {"blog_name": "qwertynerd97", "id": 683688117757198336, "date": "2022-05-08 13:16:38 GMT", "timestamp": 1652015798, "tags": ["yes I am parasocializing with a fictional real estate agent from a classic novel", "WHAT ABOUT IT?!", "Dracula daily", "qwerty at the keyboard"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZzsGYsbyyhY44i00", "note_count": 0, "body": "NOT the translater out here being sarcastic at my good friend Jonathan Harker!!\n\u201cMem., this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the \"Arabian Nights,\" for everything has to break off at cockcrow\u2014or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.\u201d\nTHAT\u2019S NOT JONATHAN\u2019S FAULT"}, {"blog_name": "juno-hoslow", "id": 683456962791440384, "date": "2022-05-06 00:02:31 GMT", "timestamp": 1651795351, "tags": ["dracula", "dracula daily", "my posts"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZAFeGwby87oESu00", "note_count": 12, "body": "it is physically impossible for me to read Dracula's lines in anything other than the most ridiculous Count von Count voice"}, {"blog_name": "jdmara", "id": 683439080892137472, "date": "2022-05-05 19:18:18 GMT", "timestamp": 1651778298, "tags": ["the only man i eagerly accept emails from", "dracula", "dracula daily", "text.dee"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZeNvVlby43aQCW00", "note_count": 7, "body": "jonathan harker is my friend "}, {"blog_name": "spectrealenko", "id": 683526667709349888, "date": "2022-05-06 18:30:27 GMT", "timestamp": 1651861827, "tags": [".txt", "dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZYuTNxbyN_7-Ke00", "note_count": 19, "body": "I am having SO much more fun with dracula daily than I had reading dracula for british literature in high school and I think it's the communal experience of it all. like watching everyone else also receiving letters from our good friend jonathan is sooooo fun"}, {"blog_name": "vampanoia", "id": 683464560996433920, "date": "2022-05-06 02:03:17 GMT", "timestamp": 1651802597, "tags": ["dracula", "dracula daily", "dracula daily may 5"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0RMaUby9sMcmi00", "note_count": 18, "body": "It is genuinely touching to see anyone and everyone trying to save Jonathan the best they can \nGuy pulls up and immediately goes \"oh, no one's here.

Oh! young Herr, must you go?' She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all.\" \nInclusion of \"hysterical\" here, while not at all unusual, is still important. Hysterical being particularly a coding for mental illness in women. Also the fact that she \"lost her grip of what German she knew,\" again, losing grip being a term that refers to losing control of an aspect of one's mind or thinking. And the particular confusion of language, which is a prevalent experience in certain neurodivergences and mental illnesses. AND madness being grounded until the industrial era in the absence of reason, with language being the predominant vehicle for reason. A confusion of language is to indicate the presence of madness. Society was built on reason, language was needed to establish reason. The tower of babel is a relevant biblical myth of how language systems were viewed as crucial to societal functioning. However, in the industrial revolution that importance shifted. Instead of society being founded on reason and the communication that required, society was founded on labor. Communication is still required, but to a lesser extent. In my opinion, this is a transition that is crucial to our existence under capitalism today. It'll be interesting to see which perspective is taken in the book. \nANYWAYS takeaways:\nLook out for coded language! There's a lot of it in here if I recall. Hysterical seeming to be the first one.\nLinguistic confusion! Both a sign and a symptom, I know it's common among us schizo-spec folk. But more conceptually, introduces themes of 'madness' as a kind of foil for 'reason,' which is how it was viewed at the time, to an extent."}, {"blog_name": "trakiul", "id": 683604591788556288, "date": "2022-05-07 15:09:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1651936141, "tags": ["Dracula daily", "my post"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZtPg6ubyfi4SOW00", "note_count": 5, "body": "trying to decide whether i should add a Dracula reread to my storygraph now. cuz like i am reading it... but i won't finish it till november"}, {"blog_name": "m-e-w-666", "id": 683509732583030784, "date": "2022-05-06 14:01:16 GMT", "timestamp": 1651845676, "tags": ["dracula daily", "draculame", "may 5"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z_r0SgbyK7hx8a00", "note_count": 8, "body": "oh may 5 is a long one. i hope i can catch up for today\u2019s one"}, {"blog_name": "thegreatblondebalrogslayer", "id": 683619165377069056, "date": "2022-05-07 19:00:40 GMT", "timestamp": 1651950040, "tags": ["dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z5unIsbyj099ym00", "note_count": 5, "body": "i think dracula daily should let you see everyone that subscribed to it in the 'to:' section for the chaos potential"}, {"blog_name": "demolitiondancer", "id": 683553712210345984, "date": "2022-05-07 01:40:19 GMT", "timestamp": 1651887619, "tags": ["dracula", "dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZDTp7ubyU7h9Ce00", "note_count": 1, "body": "guys wait i haven\u2019t read the emails yet!"}, {"blog_name": "resident-father-figure", "id": 683608296820801536, "date": "2022-05-07 16:07:55 GMT", "timestamp": 1651939675, "tags": ["dracula daily", "dracula", "maybe I can show my Dracula collection now", "is it safe?", "you mean it's cool now?"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZVWazSbygX-1Wu00", "note_count": 7, "body": "Help, I didn't realize my hyperfixation was ever going to become popular with the kiddos what-"}, {"blog_name": "dw-writes", "id": 683460125193797632, "date": "2022-05-06 00:52:47 GMT", "timestamp": 1651798367, "tags": ["dracula daily", "this man is so stupid", "his only braincell is dedicated to mina"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zr8jOjby8rpSKW00", "note_count": 19, "body": "johnathan really out here being like\u00a0\u201cnothing bad will ever happen to me :D\u201d while willfully ignoring all the DANGER!

Was he planning to recruit highly placed proteges (Kim Newman\u2019s \nAnno Dracula\n\u00a0and its sequels posit an England in which vampirism has become the pedigree of social respectability)?

They share some ghost stories, and I wonder if that treasure the Count mentions is going to be A Thing or he's just being the entertainer there. So far, this reads like Belle's stay in the Beast's castle, what with no visible servants around yet all of our himbo's needs being seen to. Does Dracula really think Jonathan's surname is a patronymic, or is he just playing into his xenophobic stereotyping? He's definitely devoted to his Aesthetic(TM), having bought an old, gloomy estate in England that has huge walls and rusty gates and a creepy pond and all. He's so extra. \nHe also claims the bleak old place is because he \"seek[s] not gaiety\", which, aren't we beyond the point where we have to deny our queer dreams?

Jonathan realizes he has no way of escaping this castle, and that he is, perhaps, the only living person here. He has all rights to be terrified. And yet, and yet, his secondary reaction is to brush all his fears away as childish. After the mirror is destroyed, he is more annoyed for the sake of his shave. \nJonathan recognizes and thanks now the woman who gave him the crucifix, but even still, he was taught it was disfavourable and of idoltry. He wonders if the actual item has power or if its comforting bc it meant someone cared enough for him to give it to him for protection.  \nHis instincts are now overcoming societal nicety and expectation- but he is still pulled to engage with and is fascinated by Dracula. And that pull toward what is terrifying, this conflict, well that just makes good Horror.

Synchronous media is an event, it's fun, everybody can participate! Now we're drowning in recommendations of what we \"should watch\", and the list gets longer and longer, but even when we do get around to a particular show, we almost never properly discuss it with the friend who recommended it and it's just frustrating. \nSo yeah.

I was not expecting to become hooked on the premise of the writing being released the same days as in the books. \nI have never read Dracula or heard of Dracula Daily. Luckily for me, there was only a few entries that I needed to read to catch up on.\nI found myself surprised that I actually enjoyed reading Dracula since it was published in the 1800s. The writing is very descriptive, whether it is people or the landscape, which I personally don't really like in writing in general, however, it was necessary to set the scene and atmosphere of what I have read so far.\nMy thoughts/summary so far:\nSo Jonathan Harker is a real estate agent and that's why he's going to Count Dracula. (I actually gasped out loud when I read 'You're friend, DRACULA')\nJonathan is the classic oblivious horror main character. Like, why did he not question once of why people don't want him to go. The crowd was literally saying, devil, Satan, etc., and the lady gave you a rosary, tears in her eyes, and told you about the holiday it was. How much more warning do you need?\nThe way the carriage ride was written actually made me a bit nervous and I genuinely thought that a wolf was going to attack, or that the written equivalent of a jump scare was going to happen. (I don't watch or read a lot of horror stuff, so I get scared easily).\nWhen Jonathan and Count Dracula meet, I was expecting him to be more intimidating??? rude??? scary??? And I was surprised that he is actually nice. He got him a whole roasted chicken just for him and helped with his luggage personally, even though he probably could have asked one of his employees to do it. (also how convenient, it is that Dracula will be away until the afternoon /s)\nSome after thoughts:\nWhat was up with the glowing thing in the woods? Will that get explained? I don't know. I'll have to wait until the next time it updates. \nThe way this is formatted and now being invested in the story, actually make me look forward to the next update.\nI can just go get a copy of Dracula and read it, but something about having a lot of other people also read along side you and also discussing at the same pace as you, seeing drawings aaaaaaaaaand I just realized I am now in the Dracula fandom."}, {"blog_name": "decraziness", "id": 683595464226045952, "date": "2022-05-07 12:43:56 GMT", "timestamp": 1651927436, "tags": ["dracula daily"], "short_url":

In an echo of the way \nDracula\n is told via documents - letters, diaries, etc - \nThe Historian\n also relies heavily on them, from letters to journals to family stories to centuries-old historical documents. It\u2019s told in a nested style through three narrators, all of whom are historians - a young woman in the 1970s, her father in the 1950s, and his thesis advisor in the 1930s - with the letters/diaries/stories of the earlier narrators being experienced by the later ones. In this way, it\u2019s told across three different eras of Europe and gets into all the real historical complexities and context of those periods, such as the Cold-War-era difficulties and dangers of carrying out travel and investigations in eastern Europe. It also draws in vampire mythos from a wider range of places than the original, including a truly fascinating stint in Istanbul.\nIt moves continually back and forth throughout the three narrators and time periods in a really delightful way, and all of the characters are powerfully engaging.

Was Jonathan riding the coach for more than 24 hours? Or did he sleep more than 24 hours? What is with the timeline? There seems to be a day missing. \nHe gets into the coach on May 4. He rides for a while first with this coach, then with Dracula with a fake beard, until he arrives at Dracula after midnight, which makes it May 5. Jonathan eats, writes about his adventure under the date of May 5 and goes to sleep.\nIt could be that because it was just after midnight Jonathan has written the date of a previous day and actually all the driving took more than a day?\nBecause if not, then he was sleep ing awefully long?\nSo, after arriving on May 5 he sleeps until about 5 p.m. (of the same day? May 5?), eats his breakfast/dinner and talks with Dracula for a whole night until morning (May 6?), and before going to sleep in the morning he wrots his diary entry under May 7. When has it become May 7?\nHave I missed something? What is happening with the time?

Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it.\u00a0\nIt's so moving - when we invest things with meaning and they actually seem to work, is it that the meaning that comes true or the very fact that we invested in them? For Jon, the crucifix carries meaning despite his beliefs because of the very fact that he was once (not too long ago) amongst people who were looking out for him, protecting him even. \nAnd don't even get me started on the last line. Beneath all the fear (Jon really is scared out of his mind now!) he still wants to figure out these things, to unentangle his thoughts. And he says \"some time, if it may be\" - the future (and being alive in the future) holds the possibility of all this thought! He wants to live not only to return home and to get back to his life but also to figure out all this philosophical stuff.

He gives far more interest to the men he meets, marveling at their garments and hair, mustaches and beards, eyes and teeth. \nHe pays quite a bit of attention to Count Dracula and his driver. Who may be the same man, as both have pointy teeth and remarkable strength? And an affinity for wolves, it seems.\nStill no word on why the driver was chasing blue flames all night.\nFinally learned what Jonathan is there for. More or less.

Van Helsing, in this reading, provides an alternate \u2018good\u2019\nfather who is willing to surrender his ownership of the women.\nRichardson concludes his psychoanalytic reading of Dracula by\nexamining Bram Stoker\u2019s biography to unearth a father fixation in\nStoker\u2019s own life.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrior\nto the 1970s, the only other major piece of criticism on \nDracula\n\nwas\nRichard Wasson\u2019s \u201cThe Politics of Dracula,\u201d which addressed the\ngeographical divide in the novel between the West and the East as\nrepresented by the Balkan region. [...] Rather than being an anxiety about the father figure, the Count\nrepresents the encroaching East that threatens by subversion and\nviolence that turn the West, as represented by England, against\nitself.\u201d\n\u201cChristopher\nBentley, writing in 1972 in \nLiterature\nand Psychology, \npicked\nup the discussion of sexuality in \nDracula,\n\narguing\nthat the sexual symbolism of the novel indicated the repressed and\nrejected desires of Stoker\u2019s Victorian contemporaries. The vampire\nserves as an outlet for sexual expression while keeping the human\ncharacters suitably pure and asexual.\u201d\n\u201cPhyllis\nRoth, however, argues in \u201cSuddenly Sexual Women in Bram Stoker\u2019s\n\nDracula\n\u201d\nthat \nDracula\n\nis\na novel hostile to female sexuality and rooted in the pre-Oedipal and\npotentially hostile relationship to the mother. She points out that\nthe novel reinforces the dichotomy between the sensual woman, who is\nbad, and the sexless woman, who is good. Roth claims that the attacks\non Lucy and Mina by Dracula are the repressed desire of human men to\ncommit violence against their figurative mother.\u201d\n\u201cMark\nHennelly (1977) analyzes \nDracula\n\nas\na gnostic quest to revitalize the \u201cVictorian wasteland.\u201d\nVictorian England requires revitalization from the foreigner Van\nHelsing and Dracula, and the incorporation of new methods of thought\ninto the skeptical, scientific climate of the end of the century.\u201d\n\u201cIn\n1980, Burton Hatlen wrote on the potential of a Marxist\ninterpretation of romantic literature by focusing on \nDracula.\n\nHis\nclaim was that the vampires in\n Dracula\n\nrepresent\nthe symbolic Other that threatens the bourgeois order of 19\nth\n\ncentury England. The vampire is thus a sexual, cultural, and social\nthreat to the good professional class represented by Jonathan Harker\nand his companions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile,\nChristopher Craft (1984) discusses the ways in which \u201csexual\ninversion\u201d and the reversal of gender roles in the novel play out\nVictorian anxieties about homosexuality and sexual roles. The vampire\nmouth is of particular interest to Craft, as it is both an orifice\nand a means of penetration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn\n1988, Stevenson argues in \u201cA Vampire in the Mirror: The Sexuality\nof Dracula\u201d against an Oedipal interpretation of the novel at all,\nclaiming that rather the threat Dracula poses is that of a foreigner\nwho threatens to subvert and deracinate good English women, blurring\nthe divide between the \u201cin\u201d group of England and its outsiders.\nStevenson follows both Wasson and Hatlen in seeing Dracula\u2019s sexual\nthreat as implicitly racialized, rather than solely psychological.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording\nto Arata, the fear expressed by the novel is that the energetic and\npotent undead will overtake the sexless living of the British Empire.\nAt the same time, however, Count Dracula\u2019s behavior and methods\nboth recall British colonial practices turned against the imperial\nnation. Arata also notes that Jonathan Harker\u2019s Orientalism in the\nfirst part of the novel is reflected in Dracula\u2019s own\n\u201cOccidentalism.\u201d\u201d\n\u201cElizabeth\nBronfen in 1999, meanwhile, approaches the novel from another\ndirection, examining its relationship to death. She employs a reading\nof Lacan in her analysis, arguing that \nDracula\n\nillustrates\ntwo responses to the need to replace a deceased person with a symbol,\nlike that of a grave: the hysteric and the obsessional.\u201d\nit just is legitimately funny to me that if you look at a chronological throughline of Dracula criticism from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century you see academics of pretty much every analytical approach looking at the novel and going \u201coh I can work with that\u201d"}, {"blog_name": "unrealistic-android", "id": 683702527690162176, "date": "2022-05-08 17:05:40 GMT", "timestamp": 1652029540, "tags": ["dracula daily", "if we've ever talked you probably know what im talking about", "say anything you say about stoker and homosexuality but i know the old man wrote those scenes with a hand down his pants"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZEdj3hby-zEN0a00", "note_count": 19, "body": "i hope dracula daily maintains momentum because i cannot live not knowing how this site will react to literally anything that happens to lucy"}, {"blog_name": "a-bit-fairy-tale", "id": 683612281529073664, "date": "2022-05-07 17:11:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1651943475, "tags": ["dracula daily", "dracula", "quincey morris"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZKl5exbyhR_4ee00", "note_count": 5, "body": "I'm really excited for all the new-to-the-book folks to read Quincey.\nGet past the exaggerated accent and just take him in.
