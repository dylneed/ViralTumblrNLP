I don\u2019t think Ed sleeps on Stede\u2019s couch all the time. I think he was just in the room at the moment and decided to take a nap.\u00a0\nMost importantly, we never actually see Ed sleeping on the deck next to other crew members. And it makes sense, too. Of course Blackbeard isn\u2019t just going to sleep on the deck like a common crew member.\u00a0 Also, we know from the toe eating scene that Izzy has his own cabin, but it\u2019s not a really glamorous one. It\u2019s clearly meant for a crew member, but since Izzy has a place to himself, no matter how simple, I\u2019m assuming Ed must have one as well.\u00a0\nIn conclusion, I think Ed sleeps in the room that Stede meant to be used by his kids and I need to see footage of Ed in that room. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "buzzingbugger", "id": 683605097350103040, "date": "2022-05-07 15:17:03 GMT", "timestamp": 1651936623, "tags": ["'it takes a dedicated hand to put it through the wall'", "it came on my ofmd playlist and im foaming on the mouth", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zkeb3WbyfpRICm00", "note_count": 1, "body": "Listening to \"wrecking ball\" by mother mother and going insane over the different implications if you listen to it as a \nStede 'you-defile-beautiful-things' Bonnet song \nEdward 'make-yourself-bigger-and-scarier' Teach song"}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683230425603309568, "date": "2022-05-03 12:01:49 GMT", "timestamp": 1651579309, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbxKdF1qm00", "note_count": 1, "body": "kisses and chocolates.\nby \ngenewilderkinnie\nEd stops by Stede\u2019s classroom to give him a present for Valentine\u2019s Day.\nWords: 21, Chapters: 1/2, Language: English\nSeries: Part 3 of \nOf Books and Biker Gangs.

(this is, of course, the hurdle that trips stede later.) \nwe don't see the red silk again until after stede has left ed, after izzy has made it clear to ed that it is impermissible for ed to step out of his role. the silk that was a taste of happiness, safety, and security, that he trusted a man from another world to take and hold and return to him, that was a reminder of a person who loved him enough to give him a fine thing to hold onto even as she tried to shield him from the world it came from, a world she knew would reject him. ed lets this symbol of his past slip away, while fully taking on the mantle of the other symbol: the kraken, his shame and fear and self-loathing. he goes back further than the bored, tired blackbeard we met at the beginning of the season, the one who carried the red silk from years ago around in his pocket. he nails the outside world's caricatured construction of him to the wall as inspiration and he becomes it. he paints his face out of the picture, throws his heart into the sea, and retreats to a conception of himself that, while he hates it, he cannot deny it has protected him. and he has reached his limit: he needs to be protected now more than he needs to be happy or loved. I've talked before about how this reversal is not all about stede, about how it's also about ed's self-rejection, and this symbol exemplifies that well. \nwhat makes me really sad about that scene is not that ed threw away something stede alone had touched, something that was a symbol of stede's love. he does plenty of that later. what makes me really sad is that ed throws away this symbol of his hope for himself, his mother's hope for him, the hope that maybe, against all odds, he could someday be the kind of person who escapes the cycle of poverty and trauma. the hope that she gave him, in the only way she could. and all that's left behind is the kraken. all that's left behind is the ultimate expression of that cycle on ed, of what happens ahen the only way left to protect yourself and the ones you love is to do more violence to them before they can do it to you. without a thread left of the hope for another way. \nand where I hope ed can get eventually is an understanding that him committing that original violence was not unforgivable. its unforgivable that the world put him in the position where he had to do that violence, but doing it was just as much an expression of love as what his mother gave him. he was doing the only thing available to him to make the world a little better for someone. his story is already a potent rebuttal of the lie that if you do violence against someone to stop them doing it to someone else, you become no better than them. killing his father hurt ed deeply, but he didn't let it consume him, and he fought to occupy a position where he could be safe without ever doing it again. that's what I hope he gets to see by the end of his story. he doesn't need to be afraid of the kraken, because the driving force was always love, always the fact that he was a good person in an impossible situation, all the way down.

a rare mark of happiness on his ever frustrated right hand man, making the lie feel all that much deeper.\n\"i know,\" ed says, arms out, alluding to an emotional openness that is not really there. at least not with izzy.\nhe turns away from izzy and his smile disappears instantly, replaced by this dull, bored, tired look. and a heavy sigh. literally his mask dropping. izzy had pegged him right to begin with, as far as he's concerned - as an unpleasant shell of a man. but then he took izzy through a rollercoaster of guilt and relief and incredible hope, with all of it being for nothing. \noh the sand is clean / oh my mind is clean\nnow technically verging more into headcanon territory for a sec: i think this is evidence of ed having a distinct awareness of how needlessly far he's strung izzy along, just to keep himself from losing the person who knows him best. whether it's accurate that he's been nothing but selfish about izzy (and i don't think it is, izzy is definitely an active player in their toxic and passionless bond), it's how ed feels. \nas deep and beautiful as we the audience see ed's fixation on the very concept of stede even before meeting him, ed likely believes that it's going to wind up being as trivial as izzy does. he far underestimates his own capacity for feeling, having been driven to a position where feelings are better off disregarded and repressed. worse so, at this point in life he's straight up forgotten what is normal and what isn't. he feels not only trapped by others but by himself and his natural limitations, and he's insecure in the most tragic and messy of ways.\noh the stream is long / yes my dream is wrong\nwhich is, whereas i think stede's insecurity lies more outward, ed's are about his insides. when he consciously looks inward he feels innately flawed, inhuman, incomplete. behind his assumption that he's unlovable is a belief that\n \nhe himself is unable to love.\nand even with all that stede manages to bring out of him... what a deeply damaging insecurity to have."}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683287023234252800, "date": "2022-05-04 03:01:24 GMT", "timestamp": 1651633284, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbxXUrhWm00", "note_count": 2, "body": "Want to do something weird?\nby \nprofessorplum221\nPirates in love swap more than just outfits.\nWords: 1925, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English\nSeries: Part 2 of \nFrom the ocean to the shore\nFandoms: \nOur Flag Means Death (TV)\nRating: \nExplicit\nWarnings: \nNo Archive Warnings Apply\nCategories: \nM/M\nCharacters: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nStede Bonnet\nRelationships: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach/Stede Bonnet\nAdditional Tags: \nConsensual Non-Consent\n, \nRoleplay\n, \nOral Sex\n, \nAnal Sex\n, \nEstablished Relationship\n, \nRomance\n, \nBottom Blackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nTop Stede Bonnet\n, \nFace Slapping\n, \nSmoking\n, \nLight Bondage\n, \nLight BDSM\n\nsource \nhttps://archiveofourown.org/works/38776971"}, {"blog_name": "blackhannetandco", "id": 683461120247382016, "date": "2022-05-06 01:08:36 GMT", "timestamp": 1651799316, "tags": ["he was a fucking lunatic for this and i love him", "ofmd", "my posts"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z2U6xRby94IA8i00", "note_count": 3, "body": "Insane how Ed knew Stede for a few weeks and felt safe enough with him whilst in the midst of a breakdown to tell him that he killed his father and hadn't killed anyone since.

At that point, Blackbeard has probably been a pirate for\n \nmaybe a year\n \nand as a pirate captain he has only a few months of experience over Stede. \nGranted, he did probably have years of experience at sea, unlike Stede. Heavily disputed sources claim he may have worked on ships since 1706 and may have been a privateer since 1713. So he may have had a decade of experience in sea faring, navigation, and possibly even combat at sea.

My dad always gave an extreme importance to fine things and manners, so you can imagine.\n*He was sad during the last episode and he felt really bad for Ed when he saw how depressed he was. \n*He said he wanted to abbandon Jack on a desert island XD \n*\"We all need a friend like Lucius in our lifes\" when he saw him trying to help Stede after Ed left.\n*His face during the \"Have you ever been sketched?\" scene was something like this:  (\uff1b\u2609_\u2609) \"I was expecting him to punch him or kiss him...or both\"\n*\"let me guess, the angry chihuahua is your favorite\" (while pointing at Izzy). He was not wrong. \nI\u00b4m pretty sure I'm forgeting some other things he said, but you have no idea the HUGE step this was for him. The simple act of deciding to watch it with me was something I would have never expected from him and when he did it, I was honestly expecting mean comments all along, but he laughed, he asked sincere and respectful questions and he learned a lot! I can't put in words how much this meant to me and the enormous step ahead this was in the relationship with my dad. \nI know he's still learning and somethings are difficult for him, but at least know he's not judging and he's trying to educate himself which is so important.\nWhen I told my brothers about this, they couldn't believe and they were as happy as I was. \nSo thats all I wanted to say, I apologize if there were any mistakes (english is not my native language) but I really wanted to share this because it meant everything <3"}, {"blog_name": "feuillyton", "id": 683744640874283008, "date": "2022-05-09 04:15:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1652069702, "tags": ["ep 5 is a banger from beginning to end but that might honestly be my favourite joke", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z_G-ixbz9Y3KOu00", "note_count": 1, "body": "the sheer fucking comedy of stede in ep 5 going \"not really the crowd for skull talk\" only to be accosted literally 5 seconds later about phrenology"}, {"blog_name": "tryxyhijinks", "id": 683050610112741376, "date": "2022-05-01 12:23:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1651407823, "tags": ["i feel my subconscious really captured his essence", "izzy hands", "ofmd", "wwdits"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZWaPTwbwhkapOa00", "note_count": 17, "body": "The kid was sick in the night, so I dozed in the armchair at around 6:30 this morning and dreamed that WWDitS had a special between-seasons episode in which Izzy Hands revealed he was an energy vampire by attacking Moana while moaning at the camera \"oh no I'm a bad person look what I've done don't you adore me I'm \nconflicted\n!\" And then cackling."}, {"blog_name": "gee-thesadmf", "id": 683148899511304192, "date": "2022-05-02 14:25:59 GMT", "timestamp": 1651501559, "tags": ["ofmd", "gentlebeard", "taika waititi", "blackstede", "blackbeard", "ed teach", "trans blackbeard", "trans edward teach", "trans stede bonnet", "nonbinary blackbeard", "genderfluid blackbeard", "genderfluid edward teach", "gay pirates", "gay pirate brainrot"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZUjpRSbx24ty4W00", "note_count": 11, "body": "I've seen a lot of trans ed posts but consider this: trans he/they stede bonnet (him and Mary were t4t) and genderfluid  amab ed\nidk that's how I see it"}, {"blog_name": "notebooks-and-laptops", "id": 683564129906311168, "date": "2022-05-07 04:25:54 GMT", "timestamp": 1651897554, "tags": ["ofmd", "steddy hands", "blackbonnet", "stizzy", "blackhands", "stede bonnet", "izzy hands", "edward teach"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZVPSnWbyWVHOGy00", "note_count": 203, "body": "Steddyhands is fun because each of them have a Type even tho at first glance it would appear they do not\nStedes type is Leather Wearing Dressed All In Black Competent At Pirating Could Probably Kill Me Has Probably Stabbed Me, I Could Fix Him \nIzzys type is disaster drama students who are entirely Extra about everything they do in life (and who will send him to an early grave or at the very least give him a headache)\nEds type is bitchy, stubborn men who dress in fine clothing (LOOK at Izzy folks and tell me I'm wrong his outfit is on point and kinda formal looking) and who he trusts enough to Know His Secret About Killing.

And that\u2019s not to say those consequences don\u2019t matter; it\u2019s terrible that his father was emotionally abusive, that he was bullied by his peers, that he felt alienated from his family. However, nobody was going to repossess his house because he wasn\u2019t performing masculinity up to their standards. He was never going to have to worry about where his next meal would come from because of it. \nFurther, Stede has the privilege to walk away whenever he feels like it. He can \u201cupend his entire comfortable life to become a pirate\u201d and then \u201cun-abandon [it] on a whim\u201d and STILL face no economic consequences for any of it. \nEd, meanwhile, cannot just walk away from being Blackbeard because his legend is his only source of income. He can\u2019t simply \nchoose\n to stop being a pirate and be soft instead because, for him, the consequence of failing to perform the ideal of masculinity is death. In a fair and equal world, Ed would be able to wear all the silk robes and throw all the talent shows he wanted to, but that is not the world he lives in. \nPiracy was supposed to be his escape from poverty, but all it\u2019s managed to do is allow him to stave it off, and become a prison unto itself in the process. Ed is trapped, not by toxic masculinity, but by economic desperation. No matter how hard he tries, he\u2019s still not one of \u201cthose kind of people\u201d and he never will be. That\u2019s the symbolism of him throwing the red silk away at the end of ep 10: the acceptance that \u201cyou wear fine things well\u201d was only ever a dream for him and that dream is now dead.

Ed and Izzy are a pair of badass borrowers. Maybe part of a guild that specializes in human defense, like they\u2019re trained to be able to kill humans if it means protecting borrower kind. They stumble into this bar called The Revenge, looking to get drunk, and Ed is just immediately enamored by the place. It\u2019s unlike any human bar he\u2019s ever been in (and he\u2019s been in a lot, probably lived in one at some point). It\u2019s so colorful with a mini library in the corner, and the regulars are just as colorful as the place itself. Ed decides he wants to stick around and learn more about the owner of the place, much to Izzy\u2019s consternation.\nLucius is Stede\u2019s first hire, but he\u2019s generally flirting more than he is working. Roach is the bartender (cook too if there\u2019s a kitchen). I think Black Pete and Frenchie should be borrowers simply bc I think it\u2019s adorable. Maybe Wee John knows about borrowers (is besties with Frenchie already) and just happens to be one of the regulars at The Revenge. He sneaks drinks to Frenchie until he\u2019s so plastered he falls out of his pocket to everyone\u2019s surprise. \nI still want their first meeting to be Ed saving Stede\u2019s life. Maybe Stede is attacked in his apartment above the bar by some homophobic assholes. He\u2019s left bleeding out on the floor and Ed can\u2019t just let him die there, all alone. So despite Izzy, despite what he believes about humans, despite having killed humans himself, he runs to Stede\u2019s side. Somehow he manages to wrangle his phone that\u2019s as big as he is and call 911. Stede is just absolutely flabbergasted and wonders how his night could get any weirder when he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.

Yeah it's extortion still but I did almost kill him.\nAnd Lucius reminds Stede that he is a pirate, and this is fairly expected pirate behaviour so like. How would u punish this if anything I'm the most pirate acting pirate on this ship rn, this is what success looks like\nAnd they're all right but that means there really isn't much they can do abt it, so they just expand the trips to include Stede and Black Pete so then it's less extortion and more Boyfriends Day Out \nLike I've loved everything they did for him re: wardrobe so far so I just am dying to see them go All Out with Lucius.

You have our good old action standby, sparring as flirting/foreplay/unresolved sexual tension. You have that big moment of buildup. And once the actual uhh penetration happens, they are standing super close together--Ed has his hand on Stede\u2019s shoulder and Stede has his non-stabbing arm around Ed\u2019s waist/ribs for most of the scene, and as soon as he pulls the sword all the way out he grabs either Ed\u2019s arm or his torso to steady him. (It\u2019s very out of focus in the background of Izzy\u2019s shot but you can kind of see what\u2019s happening thanks to Stede\u2019s white shirt.)\nYou can imagine exactly how this scene would play if it was in a different genre, or if it involved different people--if, say, it was Jack or Izzy instead of Stede. And while it\u2019s definitely being played for comedy (they are really going to town on those moans; I wanna know how many takes were ruined because one of them cracked up) I think the main reason it doesn\u2019t particularly read as sexually/romantically charged is that Stede is too worried the whole time about hurting Ed to think about anything else.\nAside from the fact that I think Ed definitely sees this as a flirtation and I don\u2019t think it ever occurs to Stede to think of it that way...violence-as-intimacy has never been how they relate to each other. It\u2019s not really a language Stede speaks. It\u2019s something from Ed\u2019s world, and we see both the gleefully nihilistic frat boy version of it with Jack and the unbearably repressed, fucked-up-substitute-for-tenderness version of it with Izzy. But in Stede\u2019s Muppet universe genre bubble, intimacy is just...intimacy. And it\u2019s not just Ed and Stede--we see it between Lucius and Pete, Oluwande and Jim, and in platonic interactions like Lucius comforting both Stede and Ed after their breakup. There aren\u2019t any Intricate Rituals because they don\u2019t need them.\nAnd what I love love love is that intimacy-as-intimacy is how Ed chooses to relate to Stede from the beginning. He\u2019s sitting at Stede\u2019s bedside playing out every hurt/comfort fic trope before they\u2019ve even had a proper conversation!

Definitely really picks up in the second half, haha. Which is, y\u2019know, not necessarily a great thing, but maybe it\u2019s only so marked because it\u2019s such a short series. I remember it took several episodes for Brooklyn 99 to find its legs, but that show benefitted from longer seasons (in the first few years anyway), and \nmore\n seasons, which can drown out a shaky start. OFMD will probably get at least one more season as well, so \ud83e\udd1e.\nAnyway, I liked these episodes very much! Stede getting his Nigel Thornberry on, Ed and his hatred of nature \ud83d\udc9c. Oluwande and Jim. Lucius! Jim being raised by a warrior nun, I stan!\nAnd then that asshole Calico Jack, lots to unpack out of that half hour! God, the way he and \u201cBlackie\u201d were going on honestly reminded me so much of my brother and his friends when they were teenagers and the \nstupid\n ridiculous games boys play. They used to just get a pinch of each other\u2019s arm of leg hair and rip it out to say hello. \ud83d\udc80 They had this game where they\u2019d \u201csack tap\u201d (slap the other guy in the balls with the back of your hand) that went on for years until one received an accidental but severe injury as a result. Boys. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here, we\u2019re being shown Ed is an extremely emotionally immature person. (It\u2019s the \u2728trauma\u2728). Not unlike the class-clowning on the French weirdo\u2019s boat, where he was practically bouncing off the walls, high on their short-lived validation (Class. Clown.) Stede is too, but in a different way. \nIt\u2019s kind of funny because Stede\u2019s got a childlike naivety and lack of emotional literacy, but he\u2019s also the more mature of the two of them, he\u2019s been forced to be by his station in life. He knows who he is, and he is capable of drawing a line and enforcing a boundary for himself. Whereas Ed appears to be cooler and more experienced and wiser in the ways of the world, but emotionally, psychologically, he\u2019s delayed. Still an angry traumatized teenager inside, and surrounded by people who feed his worst impulses, up until he boards The Revenge.  He has no idea who he really is, he just shapeshifts to gain the approval of whoever\u2019s willing to give it to him. He wants to be someone Stede approves of, but he\u2019s also terrified of not getting or losing that approval to the point he tries to preempt it. He and Stede are helping each other grow, but it\u2019s not an easy or quick straight-line process.\nI really like Stede in ep 8, the way he immediately clocks Calico Jack as trouble, the way he gives it a chance but removes himself from the situation when it becomes clear there\u2019s going to be nothing he likes going on that day. The way he just confidently orders Jack off his ship. \ud83d\udc9c Man\u2019s got a steel spine and some hard edges under the nice clothes and puppyish attitude! It\u2019s like with Izzy. Once he decides he doesn\u2019t care about your approval, he\u2019s free to be an asshole back. I like it!

This is a bit of a shot in the dark, since I honestly don\u2019t know the, like, normal way of meeting somebody for this purpose and have no clue if I will get any responses to this but I thought I\u2019d give it a try. I am a fic writer who has written 5 works of pure smut in various fandoms each <6000 words. Recently I wrote a stede/ed fic (\nthis one\n) that inspired me to want to write a longer, plottier sequel with angst and romance and character development and all that good stuff. I\u2019ve never tried anything like this before. I would really like to meet somebody who either has written something along these lines or is an avid reader of such things to be a sounding board/source of advice for me to work out a plan for this fic. With like, the understanding that I intend for it to be pretty self indulgent and want to have fun first and foremost, but also challenge myself a bit.

It's there as a thrumming tension-inducing base note in his childhood flashbacks. Sometimes its overlaid with other instruments or other themes (the kraken flashback especially), but more often than not, it's still there in the background or becomes the key sound of his leitmotif.\nThe first hint we get of it is when we see the silhouettes of three ominous figures from the beach in episode two, three notes on a cello in a minor key. We then cut to Izzy, Fang and Ivan and the theme mutes down to a low-pitched tremolo. There's an echo of it when Izzy and the lads speak to Buttons on a higher register of string instrument (possibly viola, but I can't say for certain), but more on this later.\nAt the end of episode two, the cello motif returns as Izzy, Ivan and Fang look out at the Revenge from Blackbeard's ship before seguing into the Dies Irae motif and the camera pans up to the flag.\nThe first time we get the full leitmotif, instead of the shortened three-note version, is when we're introduced to Blackbeard. At this point, he's only shown from angles that obscure his face, wreathed in smoke, ominous and threatening, though interestingly, when he points out that Stede confronted and beat Izzy more strings come in with a slightly jauntier melody. \u00a0It returns to the cello-mode when Izzy returns with the \"go suck eggs in hell\" line. \nThis recurring set of notes play over Blackbeard's hazy, fog-shrouded arrival on the Spanish vessel but as he comes into focus, the music changes with more strings coming in and an almost chirpy pizzicato as the camera pans up to his face and we see him for the first time, a counter to the grim and menacing \u00a0motif that is essential the Blackbeard theme.\nThe vaguely ominous sound returns into episode 4, when Blackbeard is sitting and watching the feverish Stede, the jaunty strings of Stede's hazy dreamlike state seguing into a tremolo cello line, but not the full motif. \nThis is where the use of the theme starts to get interesting. When Stede comes around and Ed talks to him, the theme isn't there as it has been in almost all one-to-one scenes between Blackbeard and Izzy. When Stede is left watching this unfamiliar, tattooed black-clad man poking around his room, there's a hint of the return of the recognisable motif but before it gets anywhere, the \"exquisite cashmere\" exchange happens. In this moment, flutes and strings overlay the cello transitioning into a variation of \nSatie\u2019s Gnossienne 5\n melody which becomes the recurring love theme of the show and I'm screeching. \nThe thing is that the cello motif isn't for Edward himself. It's for the character, the PR stunt, he has created in the form of the Legendary Blackbeard. It's the equivalent of the Jaws theme for the shark or the Vader theme in Star Wars. It's an iconic simple collection of notes that is a subtle hint of Here Be Danger. And to have a soft love theme butt in and go \"scuse you, he likes a fine fabric\" completely derails it.\nThe proof of this comes the next time the theme occurs: when Stede shows Ed the propaganda that the English have been distributing about Blackbeard. \"Is this what they think I look like?\" he demands indignantly, as the theme of that very persona plays. It's associated with that violent and destructive identity and it's very deliberate since we only heard it in full when we were being presented with the still mysterious smoke-wreathed silhouette of the man.\nIt becomes symbolic of every time Ed slips into \"Blackbeard-mode\", when he needs to be perceived a specific way. When he talks to Izzy about retirement and \"what if Blackbeard turned up dead\", it's there. When he's goading Stede into running him through and resorts to pulling a pistol on him, it's there. \"Be careful what you ask your God for\", he warns the crew right before he demonstrates the full power of a fuckery? Yes, again. And, very pointedly, it's also when Izzy is pressuring him to deal with Stede and \"send him to doggy heaven\".\nThis is Blackbeard's Incidental Music, the theme that follows him when he's in or meant to be in work-mode.\nI mentioned that in episode 2, there's a higher variation of it that plays, possibly on a viola, which recurs again when Izzy is trying to goad Stede into performing the fuckery. It's not quite the same theme but I find it interesting that the two times we hear it, Izzy is scheming and faking it. In the first instance, he's pretending to be \"humble travellers passing through\" to get information and in the second, he is pretending to be Stede's wingman regarding the fuckery. \nOh. He has a matching theme to Blackbeard's, on a different instrument, that only shows up when he's pretending to be something he's not to get a job done? HOW ABOUT THAT HM????\nBut to get back to Blackbeard, the motif's last appearance for several episodes comes when Izzy challenges Stede to a duel. It's fragmented, in a different pitch, and overlaid with Stede's more jaunty strings and bits of harpsichord, and then - like Izzy - it's gone. There are still cello threads there, but never the theme.\nNot until episode 10.\nNot until Izzy confronts Ed in the cabin, ripping the page from the book, shoving it in his face, saying \"this is Blackbeard\". When Ed looks at that same propaganda that upset him so much in episode 4, the theme returns, creeping and insidious. This is his theme music coming back to haunt him, playing over the marooning of the crew and into the abduction of Jim and Frenchie onto his new crew. The theme of Blackbeard the monster and the legend."}, {"blog_name": "aksarah", "id": 683508928826507264, "date": "2022-05-06 13:48:30 GMT", "timestamp": 1651844910, "tags": ["stede bonnet", "edward teach", "izzy hands", "our flag means death", "ships that sail away", "always come back to port one day", "blackbonnet", "blackstede", "blackhands", "etc etc", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0jMLsbyJx-NWm00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Buffalo Nichols - How to Love\nIf this isn\u2019t Edward, Izzy & Stede, I don\u2019t know what is.\nYou know a pretty girl will make you do ugly\nthings\n\nLike smoke cigarettes and buy diamond rings\n\nI know I am not a heartless man\n\nBut there's some things that I hardly understand\n\n\nWell\nthere's one thing you did was good for me\n\nYou showed me things that I just couldn't see\n\nMade me realize I do need love\n\nEven though in the end I wasn't good enough\n\nOh the way you hurt me showed me how to love\n\nYeah the way you hurt me showed me how to love\n\n\nI\nsold everything I had and bought a lie\n\nThere ain't a powder or a pill could ever get my hopes this high\n\nBut a life of sin it brought me to my knees\n\nLove could have been the cure but your love was a disease\n\n\nAnd\nthe way you hurt me showed me how to love\n\nYeah the way you hurt me showed me how to love\n\nOh the way you hurt me showed me how to love\n\nYeah the way you hurt me showed me how to love\n\n\nWell\nI hardly recognize you anymore\n\nIt's been so many years since you walked out of the door\n\nAnd now I see that you could hardly hurt a fly\n\nThe way you treated me was wrong but I know the reason why\n\n\nCause\nthe way they hurt you showed you how to love\n\nOh, the way they hurt you showed you how to love\n\nYeah, the way they hurt you showed you how to love\n\nOh, the way they hurt you showed you how to love\nhttps://youtu.be/b1lwlQkJEpY"}, {"blog_name": "ineffably-good", "id": 683747521829404672, "date": "2022-05-09 05:00:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1652072450, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "ofmd fanfic", "our flag means death fanfic", "blackbonnet", "blackbeard x stede", "stede x blackbeard", "so much angst", "eventual reunion i promise", "but first SO MUCH ANGST"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zec1aqbzAB_QiW00", "note_count": 5, "body": "New Fic: Scenes from a Reunion\nHave I mentioned that I'm writing Our Flag Means Death fanfics now as well as Good Omens?

What did you want to capture most about that moment in playing it with Taika, and was there anything that you decided to bring to it apart from what David [Jenkins] had on the page?\nDARBY: I wanted to make sure that the audience knew that Stede didn't really know what love was and hadn't really expected a kiss or anything like that. He was very naive to it all but was just on this rollercoaster because he enjoyed every minute of it, and he didn't know where it was going to end. I think he expected, in some ways, for Blackbeard or Ed to take the lead \u2014 which he has, in most of the things we've done on board. He's the experienced pirate, and Stede tried to give his own 10 cents by helping out with gentlemanly things and the use of cutlery and wearing fine fabrics and things like that. But there was certainly a lack of confidence in the area of... I think that's probably the same for both of them, with love.\nI really could come down to either of them probably taking that next step and just touching each other in that way. But it just so happened to be Ed, because Ed felt invigorated. He felt like he had finally let go of the persona of Blackbeard, the evil side of him. Once the beard came off and everything, he's like some dashing guy from the Mills & Boon \u2014 you probably don't know what those books are.\nI do, the romance novels.\nDARBY: The romance novels. Yeah. So he is sitting there, but he's certainly more at ease, you can see that. Because Stede isn't. Stede's realizing that he has possibly screwed everything up and that they're going to die, and I think he's got a lot more going on in his head, and you can see that when they do the kiss. Then Ed walks away, [and] there's just this really puzzled look on Stede's face where he's taking that in, but he's taking so many other things in at the same time, which are: Is this the end? What do I do here? Have I done the right thing? Yeah.

I just can\u2019t separate these two issues even though I know I\u2019m getting way too emotional over this. I guess there\u2019s not a lot of people who would be a target audience for this, but I need to get it out of my system.]\nSoooooo... So. So so so so. I made this comment on Facebook about how Izzy being a sad little masochistic boy gave me feelings no other fandom has been able to give me in about a decade. Which was a joke, of course, we all laugh at Izzy\u2019s pain kink. Ha ha. But then I realized it\u2019s also very much not a joke. Because I \ncan \nindeed remember the last time I felt like this and it was when I first watched \nLawrence of Arabia\n. And that movie turns SIXTY this year.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nLet\u2019s be clear. Izzy IS a masochist, plain and simple. I\u2019ve already written about how I think he\u2019s more into power play than pain itself, but then I do realize how often these seem too similar to be simply labeled as one or the other. These things are way too complex to be simply analyzed and quantified as often pain becomes a tool of power. And I don\u2019t necessarily mean\u00a0\u201cpower\u201d as in a relationship between two people, it may also mean (and often does) power over one\u2019s own body, and in a larger perspective, one\u2019s life.\nIn episode 3 there\u2019s this scene with Izzy back on the ship, giving Blackbeard a report on Stede. He comes into Edward\u2019s cabin and tells him how Stede isn\u2019t interested in meeting. And while doing that, he burns his hand on a candle. Edward has his back to him, so he\u2019s probably unaware that Izzy is even doing it. So he\u2019s not doing it for Ed (I\u2019ve written about the power exchange dynamics between them \nhere\n), he\u2019s doing it for \nhimself\n. Is he punishing himself for lying to Edward (\u2019cause he didn\u2019t tell Stede he was working for Blackbeard because he didn't want them to meet)? Is it a way of proving to himself that he\u2019s strong - unlike Stede - and therefore worthy of Edward\u2019s attention? Does he even know why he\u2019s doing it? I really don\u2019t think he does, I think it might be something that he just does instinctivenly and without any deeper thought (especially seeing that he does the same thing in episode 7 while talking to Spanish Jackie and accounting for the fact that he\u2019s not the type of person to analyze his feelings in general). And I absolutely adore it to bits.\nIt\u2019s shown from a few different angles, so we\u2019re being made aware that it\u2019s important. But at the same time he\u2019s talking to Ed about Stede, like him doing it wasn\u2019t \nall THAT \nimportant. Like it\u2019s just a thing that he \nhappens \nto do while carrying on with his responsibilities as Blackbeard\u2019s second-in-command. And yet the camera shows him burning his hand with nothing else happening visually. It goes on for about ten seconds, which is A LOT when it comes to movie editing. They\u2019re coding it as something that is \nBOTH \na crucial part of his identity \nAND \njust one of his many traits. (And it\u2019s not just here that they\u2019ve done this, the scene when Ed cuts off his toe with \nAvalanche \nplaying in the background with its lyrics about conquering pain is just pure damn genius.) And honestly, when did that ever happen before?\n-------------------------------------------------------\nNow, I know there\u2019s been a considerable and overall very positive move to normalize BDSM lifestyle and practices. (\nAnd I\u2019m certainly NOT talking about the horrible abusive garbage like \n50 Shades of Grey \nor \n365 Days.\n) But it always seems to go one of two ways, neither of which makes me feel the way OFMD makes me feel.\nSo, on one hand we have the media meant to educate \nvanilla \npeope about the issue, while at the same time trying to build their capital on being somewhat \nnaughty\n, with Netflix\u2019s \nBonding\n\u00a0being the prime example. I\u2019ll be the first person to say that the show was important in disspelling a number of popular misconceptions and trying to broker some deeper understanding between kinksters and the rest of the populace. Hell, I LOVED the talk about trust and boundaries Tiff is given by her boss in the second season. But its characters - those who are truly into the lifestyle and not just in it for the money - don\u2019t really come off as fully fleshed characters. They are mostly just Tiff\u2019s clients and are often characterised solely by their kinks. And that makes it impossible to relate to them.\nThen we get the shows with well rounded characters who just happen to be more or less tangentially connected to BDSM, for whatever reason. Irene Adler being a dominatrix on BBC's \nSherlock\n. Kat doing the video dominatrix stuff in the first season of \nEuphoria\n. Joanna and Tyrell doing bondage on \nMr. Robot\n. That whole fake-kidnapping-actual-s&m-roleplay thing on \nCucumber\n. It happens more and more which is great. But it never really felt all that important to who any of these characters really are. It\u2019s usually about money or just a simple way of quickly allievating boredom in the bedroom (which are both totally valid, to each their own, it just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s something that is \ncrucial \nto the core identity of any of these characters). Or worst of all, it\u2019s just an embarrasing eccentricity intended as a pun. So of course I can\u2019t really relate to any of it, even if I do appreciate it being shown in mainstream media at all.\nIf hard pressed for an answer about any representation I found compelling, I\u2019d have to say that \nTransparent \nhit the closest to home with Sarah\u2019s experiments with BDSM, but even that felt more like a three-episode-long subplot rather than an attempt to really make it an integral part of her character. And then I\u2019m given Izzy. Izzy for whom his masochistic tendencies seem so deeply ingrained that they are crucial to who he is. And yet he isn\u2019t at all reduced to being just the \nsad little masochistic boy\n, because there\u2019s also so much more to him. No wonder I\u2019m so drawn to him, because the only other piece of mainstream media that made me feel so seen is sixty years old.\u00a0\n-------------------------------------------------------\nI\u2019m not at all saying that what Izzy is doing is in any way healthy. His relationship with Edward - the \nonly \nmeaningful relationship in his life - is very toxic and right out mutually abusive. He\u2019s so fixated on the balance of power which makes him feel safe that he\u2019s willing to suffer a great deal to keep that balance - and willing to hurt Edward as well, even though he\u2019s the closest thing to a friend Izzy has. A point has been made (\nhere\n) about how he feels that he only deserves physical closeness when it\u2019s justified by his own defeat. He clearly craves submission and yet he has to be forced into it - and I don't mean \"forced\" in a fun, playful, BDSM-like way, I mean he literally needs things to be done to him without his consent. He doesn\u2019t just need pain (which is fine), he needs \nabuse \n(which most definitely isn\u2019t). Because Edward making this decision for him means he doesn't have to acknowledge this need. Because acknowledging that he wants to submit to another man would shatter his self-image and make him feel weak, which he can't afford. None of this is healthy.\nBut. Let's imagine for a moment that he was to learn to let his guard down and let go of the toxic masculinity he's so dedicated to - which would also very much help him stop seeing his need for submission as shameful (because it's toxic masculinity, with its inherent homophobia, that tells him that no \nreal man\n would be willing to submit to another). I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s going to happen, I\u2019m not even sure if I want it to happen. But let\u2019s just imagine it. That wouldn't stop him being a masochist. These needs don't just go away, but you can learn to fulfill them in a safe and healthy (both physically and mentally) way. To find a healthy outlet for them. The feeling OFMD gives me is that everybody around Izzy would be 100% fine with him being \nlike that\n. And \nTHAT \nfeeling is so very difficult to come by.\nWhy exactly does the Kraken cut off Izzy\u2019s toe? Sure, it\u2019s a punishment for threatening him and being disrespectful in general, Edward is full of rage and acting out. But I don\u2019t believe he would necessarily do that if Izzy wasn\u2019t the way he is. Blackbeard recognizes that in order to trust him again, Izzy \nNEEDS \nthat punishment. It is fucked up for sure, because their whole relationship is fucked up, but there IS the act of recognition that this man needs pain (and humiliation of being made to eat the toe) to feel safe in the world. Edward ACKNOWLEDGES that Izzy needs this even though Izzy himself isn\u2019t capable of acknowledging it. What Ed is doing here is that in his own twisted fucked up way he is actually showing respect for who Izzy is. (Then there is the confrontation between Jim and Spanish Jackie\u2019s husband. Jim spits him in the face and he quite matter-of-factly tells them that he\u2019s into that. And everyone around just accepts that, and I didn\u2019t get any feeling that they judged him for that in any way.)\nWhat OFMD was able to do that no other TV show has done for me before is to create a safe space for pretty much everyone (I \ndo \nget the criticism of it glossing over the implications of Stede being a slave owner, but that\u2019s quite a different conversation). We get multiple queer couples on the show, we get a non-binary representation, we get a huge and diverse POC representation, we get a wonderful discussion of toxic masculinity and a brilliant deconstruction of the stereotypical top/bottom dynamics in gay couples (in the fencing lesson scene, with Edward being the more experienced one and still being the one who gets penetrated by the \nvirgin \nStede). And for the first itme in oh-so-many years (or maybe ever?) we get a world where I feel being an out masochist would be fully accepted by everyone \nand yet \nit wouldn't get you reduced to just this one aspect of your identity in their eyes.\u00a0\n-------------------------------------------------------\nAs someone whose policy has always been total openness, over the years I\u2019ve had people approach me and ask what the appeal was. Why did I enjoy getting hurt. And I really DO get the curiosity, because it\u2019s very counter-intuitive for most people. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s so hard to explain it to someone who isn\u2019t \nlike that\n. Either you feel this way or you don\u2019t, and if you don\u2019t, understanding may be quite difficult.\nSo I\u2019ve always used one of two things to try to explain how I feel about it: \nBob Flanagan\u2019s poem \nWhy?\n \nor the opening scene from \nLawrence of Arabia \n(\nthe trick, William Potter, is NOT MINDING that it hurts\n), because these were the only pieces of media I could truly relate to. But then, one of these is just a short poem by a man who\u2019s best know for being \nthat guy \nfrom the music video for \nHappiness in Slavery \nby Nine Inch Nails, so it\u2019s hardly mainstream media. And the other is a sixty-year-old movie - based on a ninetysomething-year-old book - which is deeply problematic in more than one way (from glossing over just how dishonest Lawrence was with the Arabs concerning their chances for actual independence to Alec Guinness playing an Arab prince which is just totally off-putting).\nAnd then I\u2019m given Izzy. Yes, he is a horrible and toxic man who\u2019s both abusive towards everyone around him and dealing with his own needs in an extremely unealthy way that borders on being self-destructive. BUT. He\u2019s being acknowledged for what he is, both by the characters within the show and the creators who make sure the viewers won\u2019t miss it. And yet he\u2019s not \njust that\n, he\u2019s his own person, with his own motivations and feelings that go way beyond his proclivities. AND he exists in a world where him being like that would most probably be completely fine with people around him. No wonder I\u2019m losing my mind over it. Because I was given a piece of modern mainstream media that makes me feel more seen and more validated than I even thought possible.

There are racist characters who make racist remarks, but they are always 1) portrayed in a negative light and 2) punished for their bigotry by death/humiliation/other negative consequences. \nOFMD is set in a world where homophobia will always be overcome within the narrative, and where it\u2019s not a serious obstacle for the characters (so far, at least) but it absolutely exists. It\u2019s why some of Calico Jack\u2019s remarks towards Stede sting so much; his remarks poking fun at Stede for being effeminate/soft (to his mind) are absolutely microaggressions that would not hit the same way in a world where being queer is a completely accepted norm. \nThere\u2019s also the scene where Stede comes out to Mary, by saying he\u2019s in love with Ed. You can see that Mary understands what it means when Stede corrects her about Ed\u2019s pronouns, and when she hugs him she\u2019s saying \u201cit\u2019s alright, I accept who you are and I hope you find joy.\u201d That hug would not have happened the same way if Stede had been in love with a woman -- and it also wouldn\u2019t have happened if being gay was totally normalized in this universe. \nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever going to be huge plot points in OFMD that revolve around the characters dealing with/confronting/encountering homophobia (nor would I want there to be, it wouldn\u2019t fit the show\u2019s tone), but it\u2019s around, and it informs the thoughts/actions/words of the characters.\n(and how else would Izzy be both gay and homophobic.

So everyone just accepts that on occasion Izzy will throw a hissy fit, passive aggressively pack up the dinghy, and Ed\u2019s gotta go down there all, \u201cNooo, mate, we totally need you, don\u2019t leave, what the fuck am I gonna do without my fearsome First Mate?\ud83d\ude44\u201d \nReally\n laying it on thick so Izzy can soak up enough Toxically Approved Praise to survive another couple of weeks. Meanwhile, the crew is just watching this sad production, exchanging knowing glances. They\u2019ve TRIED\u00a0to be nice to Izzy\u2014the whole mutiny thing was so last year, dude!\u2014but outside of The Ritual he will straight up bite off anyone\u2019s head who so much as tries to smile at him.\n\u201cOh, you think \nI\u2019ve\n got a flight or bite response? Mr. Hands earned his last name for a reason, laddie,\u201d Buttons says while staring pointedly at Lucius\u2019 finger. That\u2019s obviously bullshit, but Buttons likes fucking with them on occasion. It\u2019s great fun.\nStede\u2019s place in The Ritual varies depending on everyone\u2019s mood. Usually, he treats it like another fuckery production, making a big ta-do about how if Izzy really insists on leaving them\u2014and wouldn't that be terrible? Simply terrible... \nright\n, everyone?\u2014then he must take plenty of supplies with him and a bottle of the good brandy and this warm coat because it can get quite chilly at night, don\u2019t you know? This allows Izzy to fly into a very cathartic rage about real pirates vs. gentry twats, leading to him oh so magnanimously deciding to stick around, if only to continue saving Ed from this dithering fool. Sometimes though Izzy has legit pissed Stede off, just like in the old days, and the crew has to run damage control to keep another duel from starting, Izzy having entirely forgotten his desire to leave under the allure of skewering Stede. That too is cathartic, but Ed tends to get tetchy when Stede stabs or is stabbed by anyone other than him.\nEvery once in a while Izzy will dig his heels in and actually launch the dinghy, heading towards\u2026 nothing, because we\u2019re nowhere near land, you idiot, are we \nreally\n doing this today? So the crew has got to drop everything else they\u2019ve got going on and just\u2026 follow him. Izzy spends a couple hours angrily trying to out-row a top of the line ship while the others watch from the deck, occasionally yelling out corrections to his form: \u201cKeep your shoulders steady\u2014you\u2019ll get farther away if you improve your posture.\u201d \u201c\nI know that!\n\u201d They let him wear himself out and then tow him in for dinner.\nOne time Lucius and Pete are ~distracted~ while on the night watch and Izzy is actually able to slip away unnoticed. He's so pissed about it that he leaves in a true huff, that anger taking him all the way to the Republic. Two days later Buttons gets a seagull from Spanish Jackie basically saying that their wayward First Mate is stinking up her bar, you\u2019d better pick him up before I kill a bitch. Ed and Stede arrive like fussy dads whose darling sent the playdate into turmoil; come along, Israel, that\u2019s enough fun for one weekend.\nSometimes Jim is already hiding in the dinghy when Izzy tries to \u201cescape\u201d and the two of them spend a day talking shit, The Revenge floating nearby. Sometimes other pirates will find Izzy in random places and sternly steer him back towards the ship: \u201cDo your \nparents \nCaptains know you\u2019re out here?\u201d Once Izzy made the mistake of loading his get-away bag with half the strawberries put aside for a new cake and Roach very nearly took a limb in vengeance. Frenchie has a couple tunes that he only plays during The Ritual, to set the mood and all. Lucius has immortalized a number of the attempts in sketch form and slips them underneath Izzy\u2019s door when he\u2019s sure he\u2019s not there to retaliate.\nYears later, when all the crew have a lot more gray in their hair, Izzy flips them off and starts packing his things, same old, same old. Ed sidles up to Pete on the quarterdeck, sighing down at the display.\n\u201cCan you believe he\u2019s still doing this?\u201d he asks, shaking his head. \u201cI thought he got it out of his system back on the Queen Anne.\u201d\n\u201cRemember that time the rope broke and he lost us that dinghy?\u201d\n\u201cHa! I was ready to flog the bastard.\u201d\nAnd \nthat\u2019s\n how the crew learns that yes, Black Pete really did serve under Blackbeard holy shit.

Because I think there's this instinct in queer media that in order to be progressive you must punish and humiliate the homophobe. And I don't have an issue with that when the homophobe is some totally straight person whose hatred is external. Every marginalized person is entitled to revenge fantasies.\nBut it's a little different for me when the character in question is themselves struggling with queer identity and feelings and the hatred is internalized. Because until very very recently, starting from a place of internalized hatred was the norm. Being raised with the understanding that you were unacceptable and would be rejected for your truth was the norm. Coming to terms with things you did or said or thought about queerness and queer people when you were closeted and terrified and hating yourself was the norm.\nAnd it oftentimes still is for the most vulnerable queer people, those who live in areas where it's still not just side-eyed but actively dangerous to be openly queer.\nSo I try to be thoughtful on how I approach and talk about characters with internalized homophobia, and I really hope the writers of OFMD will be thoughtful and take care with how they approach that story, too. Closeted queer people who hate themselves deserve the chance to grow past that, and to see representation of characters who grow past that."}, {"blog_name": "annethevampirequeen", "id": 683205274678558720, "date": "2022-05-03 05:22:03 GMT", "timestamp": 1651555323, "tags": ["ofmd", "stedebeard", "stede bonnet", "edward x stede", "twilight au", "not sorry"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZdOHnVbxEvFPuu00", "note_count": 4, "body": "Cursed idea even though I haven\u2019t even watched the show: a Twilight Stede x Edward au.

For the most part, he was being his authentic self with Stede. His behavior in episode 10 is what his masking as soft and emotionally open looks like. \nThe Kraken persona at the end of episode 10 is not a part of who Ed is; it\u2019s desperate masking to cover the vulnerable parts of himself. (This is distinct from the kraken that killed his dad, which is a part of him.)\nEd did not mean to burn that entire crew Jack mentions alive. Much like Stede with Captain Badminton, it was something of an accident that he claimed to have done intentionally to get the respect of the rest of the crew. \nWhatever their relationship might have looked like in the past, by the time of the series proper, Ed no longer gets any positive benefits from their relationship despite what Izzy may claim/think. \nIzzy and Calico Jack represent two different facets of toxic masculinity, with Izzy\u2019s being centered on power and ambition and Jack\u2019s being centered on hedonism and apathy\nAll the activities Calico Jack has them do could have been done in a fun positive way that Stede would have enjoyed (except making the turtle fight the crab), but the way Jack does them is steeped in his brand of toxic masculinity. \nSome of these I am deeply invested in and some of them just vibe well for me without having much reason for it.

But very few stories really grapple with the way cisheteronormative society convinces us that we don't deserve happiness, or kindness, or care. And they should, because that's where the bigots \nreally\n win: when they get us to do their dirty work for them by hating and hurting ourselves.\nHow many times do characters in this show deny themselves good things because they feel undeserving of them? Because they've begun to believe what hateful people say?\nJim denies themself a future and a love because they feel they don't deserve those things unless they've fulfilled their obligation to avenge their family, something not explicitly tied to their identity but still tangled up in it narratively. The scenes with Jim's nana almost trade one for the other; Nana accepts Jim's pronouns without question, but gives the reaction we all subconsciously expected anyway, when Jim reveals they haven't completed their revenge quest.\nStede walks away from Ed, hurting them both, because he believes his presence is ruining Ed's life. He actively destroys a chance at happiness because he has been convinced that being who he is and getting what he wants is a sickness that harms everyone around him.\nAnd finally, Ed denies himself the comfort of the crew and retreats into his Blackbeard persona, not because he's afraid of Izzy Hands, but because deep down he doesn't believe he deserves softness and kindness and good things because of who he is.\nEvery one of these characters has been threatened, abused, betrayed, nearly killed...but it's when they begin to believe they deserve it that they are truly undone. Which doesn't make their prior suffering their fault, but does highlight how we can sometimes get so beaten down that we start to accept the mistreatment. And when that happens, we not only stop fighting, we start seeking out the pain we think we deserve.\nIt's just...something not usually handled at length in queer media, if at all. And though it was painful to watch, it was a struggle I loved seeing acknowledged, especially by writers I tentatively trust to resolve it well."}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683566423275159552, "date": "2022-05-07 05:02:21 GMT", "timestamp": 1651899741, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbyX0fFiq00", "note_count": 2, "body": "Professional Negotiation Strategies for the Modern Co-Captain\nby \nJimsnose (alivamae)\nStede decides that co-captaining requires a more professional approach.\nOr, Stede thinks that letting Ed jerk off in his bed is somehow professional.\nWords: 2904, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English\nFandoms: \nOur Flag Means Death (TV)\nRating: \nExplicit\nWarnings: \nCreator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings\nCategories: \nM/M\nRelationships: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach/Stede Bonnet\nAdditional Tags: \nMutual Masturbation\n, \nContract Negotiations\n, \nLike professional contracts\n, \nstede is a nerd\n, \nDenial\n, \nBlack Pete hears and sees all\n\nsource \nhttps://archiveofourown.org/works/38838501"}, {"blog_name": "gaylittlegremlin", "id": 683149767950336000, "date": "2022-05-02 14:39:47 GMT", "timestamp": 1651502387, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means gay", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0B2fWbx2HWl4W00", "note_count": 25, "body": "whoever picked the songs for ofmd needs to get their ass eaten"}, {"blog_name": "nosignofpi", "id": 683150583609409536, "date": "2022-05-02 14:52:45 GMT", "timestamp": 1651503165, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "unbearable weight of massive talent", "uwomt"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZnXinqbx2TOO8y00", "note_count": 6, "body": "I love how they made Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent as a straight flip of ofmd but you can't they're still gay"}, {"blog_name": "bestfluteninja", "id": 683296867073818624, "date": "2022-05-04 05:37:52 GMT", "timestamp": 1651642672, "tags": ["the lyric \u2018i know your dying wish is to be baptized in my spit\u2019 HNGNGNGN", "the brainrot is STRONG with this one", "waterparks", "our flag means death", "i have literally no idea how to do video edits otherwise i\u2019d just do it myself", "someone. please. i will be eternally grateful"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Za-mJgbxZk5U4e00", "note_count": 1, "body": "if there\u2019s any overlap between ofmd fans and waterparks fans i need someone to make an izzy/ed edit to funeral gray when it comes out"}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683050120784347136, "date": "2022-05-01 12:15:56 GMT", "timestamp": 1651407356, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbwhdT58u00", "note_count": 2, "body": "Books at Sea\nby \nMishka10\n\"What if there's a storm? and all the books fall out?\"\nThere is a storm. all the books fall out.

So I wrote a whole AU about archaeology and mysterious lighthouses.)\nWords: 2703, Chapters: 2/7, Language: English\nFandoms: \nOur Flag Means Death (TV)\nRating: \nTeen And Up Audiences\nWarnings: \nNo Archive Warnings Apply\nCategories: \nM/M\nCharacters: \nStede Bonnet\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nMary Allamby Bonnet\nRelationships: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach/Stede Bonnet\nAdditional Tags: \nStede is an archaeologist\n, \nStede loves cryptids\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach Loves Stede Bonnet\n, \nStede Bonnet Loves Blackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nthere is no escape from the kraken/lighthouse theme and i love it\n\nsource \nhttps://archiveofourown.org/works/38828964"}, {"blog_name": "shiplocks-of-love", "id": 683510632459485184, "date": "2022-05-06 14:15:35 GMT", "timestamp": 1651846535, "tags": ["our flag means death", "live shiplocks reaction"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z4g27obyKKn-yq00", "note_count": 7, "body": "Alright babes, it's time for this bitch to rewatch and live blog E2.

That heartbreak and that betrayal, the days and days stewing in his fury, lashing out as the Kraken, all of it boiled his blood and set him up good and proper to cut that cruel, selfish bastard to ribbons. \nAll right, \ndays and days\n might be a bit of an exaggeration. It\u2019s probably been a week since Izzy shook some sense into him. Fortnight, tops. But \nstill\n. Ed had been \nready\n. He\u2019d \nhated\n Stede. He \nhad\n. \nSo when the man himself appears in Ivan\u2019s scope, waving his oar overhead like a fool and towing the rest of his miserable crew in what seems to be a makeshift raft, Ed can\u2019t blame Izzy, really, for hissing \nI\u2019ve got the cannons ready, Captain Blackbeard. Just give me the word. \nEd seizes the scope. \nHe sees Stede Bonnet. \nHe lowers the scope.\nHis heart twists painfully in the cage of his chest and then keeps twisting, something hot and bright and sick surging through his veins like sunlight. \n\u201cWhat a fucking moron,\u201d Izzy seethes. \u201cAs if he could hurt you like that and expect to be welcomed back with open arms. We\u2019re actual \nfucking pirates,\n you twat,\u201d he calls, as if Stede might hear him across the water. \u201cYou\u2019ll see what you get when you fuck with \nus\n.\u201d  He snarls, turns to Ed. \u201cShall I, boss?\u201d\nEd stares at the little dot on the water, coming steadily toward him. Stede\u2019s rowing. Didn\u2019t expect that. Crew is probably\u2014ah. Crew is probably a bit weak in the arm, weak in the everything, after what Ed did to them. \n\u201cBoss?\u201d Izzy asks again. Ed growls. He shoves the scope at him, scrubs his hands over his face, smudging the black paint there. \n\u201cJust\u2014\nwait\n.\u201d Ed growls, and stomps off to the captain\u2019s quarters. \n\u201cWait\u2026for \nBonnet\n?\u201d Izzy calls after him, shrill with incredulity. \u201cEdward, you can\u2019t possibly\u2014\u201d\nEd doesn\u2019t wait to hear what Izzy thinks he can and cannot do.\nHe slams the door behind him and stares at the hollow shell he made of Stede\u2019s quarters. Only fair, given, he thinks furiously, what Stede made of \nhim\n.\nHe strides over to the bed, yanks the curtains shut, and climbs in. There he is through the window, unmistakable, coming closer. Just as Ed absolutely one thousand percent has \nnot\n been dreaming about every night.\nThe fuck does he want? To finish Ed off? Cut out his heart, well, fuck that, he\u2019s already done that. Piece of shit, fucking \ncoward\n\u2014only\u2014\nOnly that\u2019s not what it is, Ed knows. He\u2019s been fucking thinking about it since that morning on the dock. He knows what it is. Ed wasn\u2019t enough, he wasn\u2019t \nenough\n for Stede, he\u2019d been stupid, a fucking moron, to think he was, and Stede finally wised up about it. Too weak and too broken at once for someone who shone like that, so he\u2019d cracked Ed open and scooped out the softest bits of him with a fucking snail fork and left behind the pieces. \nBut\u2026\nWell.\nWhy\u2019s he \nback\n, then?\nEd stares at the little boat for a long, long while. Izzy\u2019s going to knock any minute, Ed knows he is. \nHe wipes away the tears he hardly noticed spilling, smudging his hands black. \nHe knows what he has to do.\n*\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d Izzy says with barely controlled glee. \u201cThey\u2019re close now. Could still do cannons, yeah, but are you thinking more hand to hand?\u201d He nods. \u201cI get it. More personal.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, mate.\u201d Ed says. \u201cSure.\u201d They\u2019re close enough now that he can see Stede\u2019s in a plain white shirt. None of his fancy clothes, his curls wild in the wind. Ed still can\u2019t see his expression, but he can tell he doesn\u2019t look like the man Ed had nursed back to health from a Spanish stab wound anymore, not exactly. There had always been a sort of\u2026restlessness about him. Anxious, fluttering energy, bird-like.\nThis Stede Bonnet stands steady. Like he knows where he\u2019s going, really knows it, for the very first time.\nEd\u2019s never felt like this before. Or\u2014no, shit. That\u2019s not true. He has, twice, very recently. \nWhen he thought Stede might die.\nAnd when he realized Stede wasn\u2019t coming back for him.\nHe\u2019s\u2026terrified. \n\u201cFuck off, all of you,\u201d he growls at the rest of the crew. \u201cBelowdeck, go on.\u201d Izzy jerks a nod, grotesquely eager, and barks at them to obey. Jim, whose knuckles had been clenched white on the railing, looks like they\u2019d rather fight Ed to the death than lose sight of Oluwande again, but Frenchie manages to drag them off.\nThe rest of the crew Stede\u2019s towing, er. They\u2019re alive! All of them, looks like, which is probably good. They do look, well. A bit worse for the wear. \nAnd that\u2019s the fucking thing, isn\u2019t it? Stede didn\u2019t want him because he thought Ed was a monster, and Ed had gone and proven him right in the worst possible way. Stede\u2019s bloody \nrowing\n with a boatful of crew who, by rights, should want to take Ed apart with a filleting knife. \nEd should arm himself.\nEd should blow them all out of the water.\nEd should set course for the furthest possible bearing and leave Stede behind in his wake, for good.\nEd should. \nEd absolutely, definitely, for-fucking-sure should.\nEd lowers the ladder.\nAnd then there he is, without a weapon on him. Sea-salt in his hair and his brow creased in concern. Ed stares at him, black on his face like ink, his hands tight on his knife and his gun.\nYou\u2019ll see what you get,\n Izzy\u2019s voice echoes in his head, \nwhen you fuck with us.\nStede opens his mouth, but Ed cuts him off.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Stede blinks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d his crew choruses.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Izzy shrieks from somewhere on the ship.\nEd falls to his knees. Feels good, sagging like that, like he\u2019s stopped forcing himself to be upright. Everything just sort of crashes into him, and he buries his face in his hands. \n\u201cStede,\u201d he says, and the name feels like honey on his raw, sob-scratched throat, \u201cI\u2019m \nsorry\n. I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sorry to all of you, I fucked up. I fucked up!\u201d Ed\u2019s crying like he\u2019s done every night since he painted the guise of the Kraken on his face, tears streaking down his cheeks, open and wet and vulnerable as a bared throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you because I was hurting,\u201d he tells the crew, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I fucked everything up between us.\u201d He means to look at Stede for the next bit, but he can\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t good enough. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m \nsorry\n\u2014\u201d\nStede takes a beat, and in that brief moment Ed thinks he really has fucked everything up for good now. Stede\u2019s going to laugh at him and cut him down and even if Ed managed to survive it he\u2019s lost it all, his crew\u2019s never going to follow him now\u2014\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stede says, real wonder in his voice, \u201c...you \nlove\n me.\u201d\nEd peers up at him, scrunching his face against the sun.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d it\u2019s his turn to ask. \u201cEr. \nYeah\n. Ob\u2026viously?\u201d He gives a half-hearted shrug of a gesture, indicating the general fucking mess of his life that he\u2019s made because the man who has his heart decided to \nstomp it into the sand. \nHe sniffs, wiping his nose with his knuckle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\nBut then Stede joins him, sinking to the deck with a thud. His eyes are wide and bright, and it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s really not, that he should get to look so fucking handsome right now. Goddamn rude of him, really. \n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Stede says.\n\u201cSpeak for yourself!\u201d comes a shrill voice that Ed recognizes as Lucius\u2019s, and Ed flinches. Stede rolls his eyes, flapping his arm dismissively. \n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, you\u2019re \nfine\n. Pete, Fang, would you find Lucius some proper food? Shut him up? All right. Thank you. \nAnyway\n.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ed murmurs, twisting his hands.\nStede makes a sudden gesture that seems almost as if he\u2019s reaching for Ed\u2019s cheek, but thinks better of it. Ed gives another miserable sniff. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Stede says firmly. \u201c\nI\u2019m\n sorry.\u201d\nEd blinks at him.\n\u201cOh God, Ed, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d Stede says, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t think I \ndeserved\n you.\u201d And \nthat\n makes no fucking sense, but Stede looks really fucking stricken about it. \u201cI thought I was ruining you, my love, and I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I did, but then I figured it out, how I felt! Mary helped, actually, and now I realize that you feel the same way and oh God, you thought\u2014if I made you feel\u2014shit, \nfuck\n, Ed I\u2019m \nsorry\n\u2014\u201d\nEd furrows his brow.\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying you thought \nI \nwas the one,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cwho was too good. For \nyou\n. You thought \nyou\n were ruining \nme\n.\u201d \nStede nods very hard. His own eyes are shiny with tears now, and fuck, that\u2019s no good at all. Ed hates that. \n\u201cYes, and now I see that I \nhave\n a bit, just in the very opposite way that I thought I was, fucking \nfuck\n.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry it took so long. I\u2014the other Badminton showed up, and you were all beardless! And I got him killed too, and he said\u2014all right, it\u2019s a rather long story, actually, I should warn you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHang on,\u201d Ed says, something clicking into place. He sniffles again. \u201cI want to hear that story\u2014very badly, actually\u2014but you said.\u201d He clears his throat. Tilts his head to the side. \u201cYou said, \nmy love.\u201d \nStede blushes. \nIt\u2019s so fucking adorable Ed wants to blow something up about it. \n\u201cI did,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to\u2014well. That is\u2014only if you\u2019ll have me. Only if you feel the same way.\u201d\nEd stares at him.\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d he says hoarsely. \u201cAs if I could\u2019ve made the answer to that any more obvious. And you didn\u2019t \nruin\n me, you bastard, you made me better than I ever thought I could be.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, right back at you,\u201d Stede says, sounding out of breath.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Ed says gruffly, \u201cnow that that\u2019s sorted, should we\u2014\nmmph.\u201d \nStede kisses him.\nStede kisses him, and Ed sags into him, and Stede holds him tight.\nThe first time, Stede had been tentative. Tender, surprised, and pleased. \nThis time, Stede kisses him and Ed can tell all at once he\u2019s been thinking about it since the day they parted. \nStede kisses him hungry, hard, and messy. Stede kisses him with his hands in Ed\u2019s hair and his sturdy body pressed to Ed\u2019s unsteady one. \nStede kisses him and Edward Teach knows, for the very first time in his life, what it is to be wanted, and cared for, and loved. \n\u201cAh,\u201d Stede says, when he pulls away at last. \u201c\nWow\n.\u201d \nEd stares at him again. He\u2019s got Ed\u2019s makeup smeared on his cheek. He\u2019s beaming. He\u2019s \nsure\n. \nEd growls.\n\u201cDo that again.\u201d\nStede grins, and he does. \nPresently, Ed becomes aware of the entire crew cheering, as well as Izzy\u2019s loud groans. \n\u201cCan you ever forgive me?\u201d Stede murmurs into his mouth. God, he tastes good. Smells good. Feels good. Sounds good, even. Fucker. \n\u201cNo. Absolutely not,\u201d Ed says, taking Stede\u2019s lower lip gently between his teeth. Stede whines, and Ed nuzzles closer into him, running his hands all over Stede\u2019s chest, reassuring himself that this is actually real, this is happening. \u201cFuck off, you were such a dick, yeah? Never will.\u201d\nStede makes a contemplative sound low in his throat that goes right to Ed\u2019s cock. His hands tighten in Ed\u2019s hair and Ed moans helplessly at the gentle pressure there, and then he\u2019s dragging Ed into his lap right there on the deck. \n\u201cHow will I \never\n earn your forgiveness?\u201d \n\u201cMm.\u201d Ed rocks in his lap. \u201cI\u2019ve, ah. Got some ideas.\u201d \nStede flashes a mischievous grin.\n\u201cWell, you know me! I\u2019m all for sharing feelings. I\u2019m all ears, my love.\u201d \nEd groans and wraps his arms around Stede\u2019s shoulders, breathing him in. It\u2019s as if he can physically feel the weight of the last week leaving his body. Stede holds him so tenderly, so steadily. As if Ed himself is something precious Stede wants to keep. \nAnd fuck, Ed wants to be kept.\n\u201c\nGod\n, I missed you,\u201d he whispers. \nStede squeezes him tight, his palm soothing on Ed\u2019s back.\n\u201cI missed you too, my love. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m here now, here with you. This is where I want to be, for as long as you\u2019ll have me.\u201d\nEd pulls back just enough to look at him.\n\u201cAnd what if I never want you to go?\u201d\nStede smiles so big and earnest Ed feels like a star is twinkling right there in his chest.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll say fucking \nthank God,\n because I don\u2019t want to ever leave you again.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Ed says. \u201cOh.\u201d \nAnd when Stede kisses him, Ed\u2019s smiling too.

In the final episode of OFMD, we see both Ed and Stede attempt to go back to who they were before they met each other, and we see them both become much much worse version of themselves. In a similar sense, in Good Place, every time the four\u2019s memory gets wiped, we see all the progress they\u2019ve made be erased.\u00a0\nWhen Stede goes back to Mary, it\u2019s to try and finally become who he thinks the world wants him to be. A good, supportive husband, who helps raise his kids and look out for his wife, even if he doesn\u2019t feel the love he\u2019s supposed to for them. And he resents them for it. He resents the whole world and himself for it. And finding Mary and the kids so displeased by his return only serves to make him resent everything more. He\u2019s doing his job, so why does everyone still hate him? And he gets worse. He drinks too much, he tries to shove the glories of his pirate life on anyone who will listen, he crashes Mary\u2019s showcase and threatens Doug. And this is way different from the Stede we\u2019ve seen for the rest of the show so far. This isn\u2019t the Stede who reads bedtime stories to the crew and offered up his library to them and paid them fair wages. This isn\u2019t the Stede who tucked a piece of silk into Ed\u2019s shirt under moonlight and told him he was lovely. This is Stede in a situation he hates, surrounded by people who hate and resent him for one reason or another.\nThe same goes for Ed. Izzy reminds him that who he was before Stede is who he\u2019s \nsupposed\n\u00a0to be, and Ed realizes that that\u2019s what the world wants him to be. The world wants him to be history\u2019s greatest, most fearsome and bloodthirsty pirate. And he decides that if that\u2019s what they want then that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to get. He makes Izzy eat his own toe, he throws Lucius overboard, he erases every trace of Stede and ditches all the members of the crew except for the ones he deems useful. And he hates it. We see him cry about it, cry about Stede, and we watch the mask of who he\u2019s supposed to be slip to show who he is. The Ed who played along with Stede\u2019s adventure, who gave up killing and was content to fold socks in the royal army. This is Ed in a situation he hates, driven by someone who wants him to be one specific thing so they can use him for it.\u00a0\nThis is the two of them without love and acceptance. And it harkens so strongly back to the Good Place\u2019s message of People grow when they get external Love and support and how can we hold it against them when they don\u2019t? (I forget who originally said that but if I find it I\u2019ll tag them). Without love and support, and stuck in situations we hate, we become the worst versions of ourselves. It\u2019s not stated explicitly in OFMD, but it\u2019s patently clear in the actions of Ed and Stede with each other and their crew versus apart, and I really hope season 2 explores this more.\nAnyways that\u2019s all, thanks."}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683660763280392192, "date": "2022-05-08 06:01:51 GMT", "timestamp": 1651989711, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbysTUECq00", "note_count": 3, "body": "summer vacation\nby \nchameleonoverhere\n\"You could take them with you,\u201d she suggests.\n\u201cMary, I live on a pirate ship.

That\u2019s basically what Izzy said in his e10 speech, right? But after several rewatches (and a lot of fandom immersion), I\u2019ve realized that\u2019s not right at all.\nBecause as much as Izzy gives everyone else a hard time about using the name\u00a0\u201cBlackbeard\u201d, he almost exclusively uses\u00a0\u201cEdward\u201d when talking to the man himself. He even uses\u00a0\u201cEd\u201d occasionally. This is a BIG deal, for both of them!\nFrom Ed\u2019s side of this, we know that he used to use\u00a0\u201cBlackbeard\u201d almost exclusively. As Calico Jack says, \u201cEd? Blackie I knew would have snapped your neck for calling him that.\u201d This is coming from a man who not only saved Ed\u2019s life, but used to be his lover. But Ed lets Izzy call him\u00a0\u201cEdward\u201d in PUBLIC\u2014which we know isn\u2019t new, because Izzy isn\u2019t adjusted to the new Ed at all.\nFrom Izzy\u2019s side of things, we know that he\u2019s a very formal person, calling Lucius\u00a0\u201cMr. Spriggs\u201d and Wee John\u00a0\u201cMr. Feeney.\u201d He corrects the crew on Blackbeard\u2019s title and on his own title. And notably, when he imitates Stede, it\u2019s by saying,\u00a0\u201cOooh Blackbeard, I love the way you dress, I love the way your hair, your beard, and all that.\u201d Though of course he\u2019s noticed Stede never calls Ed \"Blackbeard,\u201d because he\u2019s yelled at Stede about it, and because he still calls Ed\u00a0\u201cEdward\u201d while talking to Stede in the\u00a0\u201cplumb the depths\u201d speech.\nEssentially, it\u2019s VERY important to Izzy that he is the only person to call Ed by his real name. He views it as a special, intimate privilege, because it WAS. And the fact that he uses that privilege, when he\u2019s normally so focused on rank, means that he views his and Ed\u2019s relationship as something more than just captain and first mate.\u00a0\nWe see that this attitude continues beyond the level of names. Izzy gives Ed the speech about needing to kill Stede in front of Fang and Ivan, but offers to do it himself when they\u2019re alone (knowing about Blackbeard\u2019s aversion to personal killing). When post-breakup Ed asks for Lucius, Izzy grudgingly brings him, but swears him to secrecy about Ed\u2019s current state\u2014before that, Izzy had very carefully made sure he was the only one to see Ed.\u00a0\nSo, how does Izzy feel when the disheveled,\u00a0\u201cWhy are we even being pirates?\u201d Ed ventures out to the crew and contradicts Izzy\u2019s\u00a0\u201cHis name is Blackbeard,\u201d by saying that he wants \neveryone\n\u00a0to call him Edward now? \nReally \nfucking betrayed. Maybe even worse than when Ed sides against him in the duel, because at least then Izzy could blame Stede for taking that special place in Ed\u2019s heart. But if \neveryone\n\u00a0calls Ed by name, and if \neveryone \ncan see him at his low points, then that means that Izzy\u2019s relationship is no longer special to Ed at all.\nFor all that Izzy was cruel in his speech, and for all that Ed felt like Izzy was abandoning the\u00a0\u201cEdward\u201d part of him... Izzy must have felt that\u00a0\u201cEdward\u201d abandoned him first.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "stede-blackbeard", "id": 683456955328741376, "date": "2022-05-06 00:02:24 GMT", "timestamp": 1651795344, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "my post"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZpbK5Sby87hHey00", "note_count": 2, "body": "I know my gender has already been transed but if Vico Ortiz, or anyone from ofmd, ever wants to trans it themselves I\u2019d be down"}, {"blog_name": "magpithy", "id": 683147328059768832, "date": "2022-05-02 14:01:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1651500061, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "izzy hands", "izzy toes", "bastard rat man"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZHkYjdbx1k0QGe00", "note_count": 16, "body": "I have a simp-hate relationship with izzy hands"}, {"blog_name": "skysofrey", "id": 683366484723056640, "date": "2022-05-05 00:04:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1651709065, "tags": ["i am unwell", "ofmd", "our flag means death", "stede bonnet", "rhys darby", "blackbonnet", "black stede", "stedward", "ed and stede"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZrSBqdbxpZ9zKq00", "note_count": 65, "body": "really spiraled over finding out stede had a tear rolling down his cheek during the kiss scene today"}, {"blog_name": "fruitbrute", "id": 683085092517707776, "date": "2022-05-01 21:31:48 GMT", "timestamp": 1651440708, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag is death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZVpKUybwpaN2uW00", "note_count": 3, "body": "I don\u2019t know man, I\u2019m just trying to act normal about a pirate show.\ufffc"}, {"blog_name": "omoghouls", "id": 683341856966393856, "date": "2022-05-04 17:32:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1651685578, "tags": ["bunny rambles", "z", "izzy hands", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZO_WgZbxjynaeq00", "note_count": 16, "body": "i think in s2 they should make Izzy a bit more bad and some how more gay- no redemption arc make him WORSE"}, {"blog_name": "snake-and-mouse", "id": 683501753414696960, "date": "2022-05-06 11:54:27 GMT", "timestamp": 1651838067, "tags": ["okay I'll stop now", "ofmd", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zs3LvmbyIJaley00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Our flag means daaammnn cum get some \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46"}, {"blog_name": "virgo-79", "id": 683326371785785344, "date": "2022-05-04 13:26:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1651670810, "tags": ["our flag means death", "david jenkins", "ed teach", "stede bonnet"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZicXmtbxgRRtyi00", "note_count": 1288, "body": "I think I figured something out.\nSo, the bathtub scene, when Ed's coming down from his panic attack and admitting he was supposed to kill Stede to Stede. \nLove it, gorgeous emotionally and visually.

He tried to discern the intent, the why behind the question. But Ed\u2019s face gave him nothing to work with.\nSo, he laid back down and replied, \u201cIt was\u2026 ordinary, I suppose. She wore a white dress and we held hands as we were wed. And then we were given our tombstones as wedding gifts.\u201d\nThe laugh that pulled out of Ed was a loud, startled sound. \u201cTombstones!\u00a0 The fuck?\u201d\n\u201cMorbid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help laughing, too. \u201cWhat a dreadful way to celebrate the start of our lives together. \u2018Here, you\u2019ll need these when you die, because that\u2019s the next step.\u2019\u201d\nEd snorted and rolled onto his side. He propped his head up against one hand, then asked in a softer voice, \u201cWhat kind of wedding would y\u2019ve wanted?\u201d\nJust as before, Stede hesitated and considered. He couldn\u2019t help the small part of him that wondered at the deeper meaning, if Ed was asking something without using the words.\nBut that seemed a bizarre notion. Marriage, between the two of them. That implied a sort of forever that he couldn\u2019t imagine. Every day was just one step closer to the day Ed hopped in a dinghy and set off on his next adventure.\nHe avoided looking into those eyes that seemed to hold an entire world of unspoken words and feelings and thoughts. Instead, he just stared up at the ceiling while the ship creaked and rocked around them.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I considered at great length,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI just knew\u2014or, well, thought, at least, that I would be marrying the love of my life. The remaining details were inconsequential, so long as I looked into the eyes that loved me almost as much as I loved them.\u201d\nFingertips brushed against the back of his hand, and he turned his palm up to intertwine their fingers together. The ceiling blurred as emotions he couldn\u2019t name surged forth and pooled as tears in his eyes.\nThat was all he\u2019d ever wanted. To love and be loved. It seemed like such a simple request, and had turned into an impossible dream.\nAnd now there was a man he loved, and loved him back, and he was, deep down, terrified of when the dream would come to an end. But the hand holding his was warm, and the man it belonged to was real, and beneath his fear was a frail bit of hope.\n\u201cY\u2019deserve it,\u201d Ed said, as if he could hear the thoughts, and perhaps he could see them in the tear that fell down Stede\u2019s temple. \u201cTo be loved. \u2018M just sorry it couldn\u2019t come t\u2019you sooner.\u201d\n( \nnext\n )"}, {"blog_name": "gnomebby", "id": 683578171428356097, "date": "2022-05-07 08:09:05 GMT", "timestamp": 1651910945, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "izzy hands", "izzy hands ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zt0YDXbyZhcaCi01", "note_count": 66, "body": "once you move past seeing izzy as just the antagonist his whole character becomes fucking hilarious. he is just a silly angry little man and it\u2019s so funny"}, {"blog_name": "totally-correct-ofmd", "id": 683290017706147840, "date": "2022-05-04 03:49:00 GMT", "timestamp": 1651636140, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "stede bonnet", "lucius ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZLM7hSbxYAQVyW00", "note_count": 89, "body": "Lucius, describing Stede to a store clerk:\n He's about this tall, blonde hair, dark eyes....

We've yet to see how this crew came to be aboard the ship, but from the get-go, Stede's goal here has been to prevent trauma, facilitate love, and frankly? Protect these guys. He:\nRefutes the toxic pirating culture of keelhaulings, beatings, and so forth.\nIn its place, he encourages 'talking things out as a crew' and being out and open about their honest thoughts. Even when these critiques jab at Stede himself, he never skirts them, doesn't refute them. Instead, he genuinely listens to what they're saying (and bearing in mind his low confidence- has a tendency to agree a little too whole-heartedly.)\nIn episodes 2, 3, and 7: the crew gets let out to go have largely unsupervised 'them time.' In episode two he specifically regards it as a vacation and encourages rest and relaxation, although there are easily 101 tasks to be accomplished even with the ship at a stand-still. Stede's privileged enough to understand the benefits of a break and wants to extend that to his crew. \nOffers genuine wages. We all know this one, but let that sink in for a moment. He didn't want them fighting for scraps between raids that never happened, it was crucial for him to pay out of his own pocket for this ragtag bunch so that they wouldn't be fighting for more than just their lives.\nOffered up his entire library to his crew. This may not seem tremendous, but I cannot emphasize how utterly mindblowing a concept that is. Those are his treasured objects, his coveted folly of a library, and he trusts this crew enough that he'd share those with them with a freaking GRIN on his face. \nUpon learning that the above offering fell short on account of illiteracy, Stede \nreads\n them the stories instead. Every night, on the deck; Stories that were likely on board for his own children. (He even does the voices!!)\nIs just so damn proud of them. The aftermath of their fuckery in episode six? That right there was a proud dad after his kids' first school play. He was even gushing to Ed about Swede's singing ability, seconds away from possibly being murdered. This fuckery wasn't a selfish flight of fancy for him- he was genuinely excited for every last one of them to give their performance. + the look on his face when they got together in episode nine to save his tailcoat?? Heart-filling shit. \nPeople have talked about how Stede took the crew on as an adopted family in absence of his own, and sure there are elements of that in here, but at the root of Stede's pirating journey, he wanted to create a space that was welcoming and safe for his crew. He wanted to show that you can gain respect and facilitate care without abuse and toxicity. \nPirating doesn't need to be a heartless, loveless place. \nBy episode nine? He proved everyone right :)"}, {"blog_name": "fieldbears", "id": 683695410152423424, "date": "2022-05-08 15:12:32 GMT", "timestamp": 1652022752, "tags": ["ofmd", "blackbonnet", "gentlebeard", "ficbears"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZpMikxby_Lfeiq00", "note_count": 17, "body": "A Gentle Swell [Ed/Stede, 6/?, E]\n\"Crew,\" Ed reads aloud one Wednesday.\n\"Yes!\" Lucius shakes the little blackboard back and forth in an excited dance. \"Yes, someone got it!\"\n\"That's not a K,\" Jim protests with a frown.\n\"A C can sound like a K or an S,\" Ed reminds them.\n\"Fuck.\" Jim sighs. \"I think C is my least favorite letter.\"\n[read the \nlatest chapter\n or start from the \nbeginning\n]"}, {"blog_name": "semisweetshadow", "id": 683185396360904704, "date": "2022-05-03 00:06:05 GMT", "timestamp": 1651536365, "tags": ["our flag means death", "the ones i'm in are not BAD I just feel very shy in them", "i'm still feeling them out~"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZKQcZybxAN_Hqu00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Joining various OFMD Discord servers until I find one that is both active enough but also chill enough.

It's tonally pretty off, swapping between grieving mothers and insufferable yanks who are like \"Omg but it was so COOL, I know people died but like, we didn't! we were badass!\" but it's still worth a watch.\nDisney's Fast Pass: A Complicated History\n (from Defunctland) - This is fucking \nsick\n, it's a documentary-length deep dive into the history of Disneyland's queueing systems and how they've impacted queueing throughout the world and varying industries, and it's really cool, I was riveted the entire time. I have autism btw.\nWhat is Gentle Parenting? A Therapist's Thoughts On This TikTok Phenomenon\n (from Mickey Atkins) - I love Mickey's channel and her work in general, but this was an interesting examination of different parenting styles and a quick little examination of the impact those different styles have on people as they develop as children and grow into adults.\nHarlots \n(cr. Alison Newman & Moira Buffini) - You guys know I live for complex portrayals of trauma and sex work respectively, plus anything set in the 18th century, and boom, here we go! Gorgeously written and depicted, really wonderful characterisation and a lot of great interplays that play a lot with intersections of class, gender, race, and all the while every single character has their own deep motivations, many with specific traumas or particularities etc. It's just really great work.\nNew Original Works Published\nErotic Short: House Call\nA guy calls in for sex at the office of the local country\u00a0doctor.\nRated E, cis M/M, 1.7k.

But I think interpreting that as Izzy being homophobic is not really correct\nI think both of those scenes actually show us the essential problem quite well- which is that Izzy strongly believes that showing emotions and vulnerability is a weakness.\nWhen he catches Lucius and Black Pete and does his whole 'oh daddy' thing, it's because he believes that this situation is something to be embarrassed of, to be ashamed of. Neither Lucius nor Pete really react to him, and Izzy just switches back to yelling and threats.\nAnd in the 'have you ever been sketched' scene it's similar. When he confronts Lucius and threatens to reveal his secrets, he has absolutely no idea what to say when he learns that Lucius does, in fact, not keep any of it a secret. That the others even support him in how he does things. But in the entire scene, it doesn't become apparent \nanywhere \nthat he has any issue with Lucius seducing men- just the fact that he goes around \"seducing\" people at all.\nBecause Izzy has this core belief that feelings and desire is to be kept to yourself. That you make yourself vulnerable if you are open about yourself (which is ironically the one thing that \ndoesn't\n grant him power over Lucius. Lucius just openly showed his hand and Izzy's entire plan of attack vanished immediately) and that it all makes you weak. Not realizing that these bonds, shown throughout the show, make people stronger.\nI do think it has mostly to do with the fact that this wretched little guy is in love with Ed and wouldn't ever even think about acting on it, maybe doesn't even fully realize his feelings- but the whole Izzy|Ed thing is a whole other point that has been explained better by smarter people than me lol\nAnyways, this is more rambling than actual analysis but I still think it's shallow to declare Izzy as homophobic when he just has some deep seated issues with emotional vulnerability \nthank you for coming to my ted talk"}, {"blog_name": "tangledinmysoul", "id": 683292798502535169, "date": "2022-05-04 04:33:12 GMT", "timestamp": 1651638792, "tags": ["nes watches ofmd", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZJQhVUbxYouKKu01", "note_count": 9, "body": "Seeing Edward cry at the end of the last episode (everytime he cried actually) was just devastating and caused a level of emotional damage I didn\u2019t know it would.

izzy did get pretty upset, but i genuinely think it was just because they weren't doing their jobs.\n  when he finds lucius drawing fang, he doesn't try to blackmail him for being gay. he tried to blackmail him for being unfaithful. if he really had a problem with the gay part, wouldnt that be his focus ?\n  going back to his opinions on ed's relationship with stede, he clearly thinks stede makes ed weak. thats the problem. not that stede is a man. he doesn't get upset at ed for having romantic feeling for a man, he gets upset at him for having romantic feelings.\n  things between izzy and the crew would have gone much differently if he were homophobic. but alas ! he is not.\nin summary, i do not like him. i dont forgive him for how he treats ed. and thats okay ! liking izzy if cool, hating izzy is cool, however you feel about izzy is cool ! as long as you dont attempt to excuse what he did. he's a (very well written) villian. please dont try to change that. \n  if youve somehow made it this far, thank you for reading all of my silly opinions, ily /p"}, {"blog_name": "craycraybluejay", "id": 683755040786235392, "date": "2022-05-09 07:00:21 GMT", "timestamp": 1652079621, "tags": ["ofmd izzy", "ofmd", "ofmd spoilers", "episode 6", "so relatable it hurts"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zk2BEVbzBvO-Sa00", "note_count": 1, "body": "Watched episode 6.

But whalers also come in pairs: for every headsman is a harpooner (for every necromancer a cavalier, perhaps?) and together they form a singular unit. A legend may be prescribed to a single man, but there is always another standing in the shadows and holding him up into the light. Izzy does everything Edward cannot and will not including feeling fear. Stubb calls Starbuck careful and he doesn't mean it negatively: a careful sailor will survive longer. Izzy has known cautious pirates and he's known smart pirates and he's known reckless pirates and they've all been good, but it's not enough to be a good pirate. Good pirates end up on the ocean floor every day. It's Izzy's job to keep Blackbeard alive, to keep the ship running, to keep them all fed and outfitted and prepared for whatever might come next. And Izzy is afraid. He has too much fear to cope with so he bottles his own up and places it on a dusty shelf to never be touched and then he addresses all of the fear he takes on for Edward. He worries about the weather and the rations and the ship repairs and their next prize and the public perception of Blackbeard and he handles it all. He knows what's at stake if he lets a single thing slip through the cracks. And he is just barely keeping it all together. As the plot progresses, fractures crack through his carefully constructed veneer of personality. When Stede tricks him in the woods, when Edward and Stede swap clothes, when Lucius confronts him, when Edward turns away from him during the duel, when Edward and Stede sign the act of grace, his own personal fears come bubbling closer and closer to the surface. Ishmael says that Starbuck's fear is what keeps him alive. He frames it as a sort of pragmatism which his fellow mates are sorely lacking. A frantic and fearless captain needs a grounded and honest first mate. But just like Ed ignores Izzy's voice of reason, Ahab pays little heed to Starbuck's pleas for them to turn back to Nantucket and give up on this perilous fool's errand. And in doing so, he dooms them all. Izzy refuses to let Blackbeard or himself suffer the same fate, damn the consequences. He'll do what has to get done to ensure they don't all die at the hands of Edward's obsession with an unattainable dream."}, {"blog_name": "cupidschockhold", "id": 683028482105737216, "date": "2022-05-01 06:32:00 GMT", "timestamp": 1651386720, "tags": ["my next writing project", "our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZAFcZTbwciaVOm00", "note_count": 2, "body": "stede and izzy are reluctant friends. blackbeard is actually smoke (sometimes). and the Revenge is packed with munitions and a crew that knows a slight bit more knowledge about seafaring.

There are definitely some very important similarities between the two shows. But ultimately, I think that their themes and massages are very different in a very fundamental way. \nA very central theme in both shows is the violent and destructive nature of 'civilized' society, and the way it affects people who deviate from its norms. But each show treats these issues from a very different perspective. I think there are two main differences:\n1. Black Sails focuses on society, through the lens of the individual. The main story it tries to tell is about big social issues, and it uses the stories of its various characters to do so. I'm not saying it makes the characters less interesting or complex - in fact I rarely see such complex and interesting characters on tv - but this is ultimately a story about society.\nOur Flag Means Death, on the other hand, focuses on its character. It's the story of Stede and of Blackbeard. It's the story of Jim and Lucius and everyone on the crew. It's a story about the individuals, and how society's problems and injustice affect them. But society here is the background, not the main stage.\n2. The other main issue on which I think the two shows differ is love.\nIn Black Sails, love is not the main theme, but it's a very important and ever present one. But despite it being so central to the story, Black Sails says again and again: love is not enough. Love alone will not bring you peace. Love will not solve the injustice you suffer otherwise. Love in Black Sails is framed mostly as a great motivater: love can make you take a stand, losing love can make you rage against injustice, the fear of losing love can make you betray and choose the status quo.\nIn Our Flag Means Death, love is the main theme. And this show looks at love as a solace, something that has healing power to help you overcome the damage society has done to you. It says that someone who looks at you with love and understanding can help you defeat the way society has made you look at yourself.\nI think both massages are very important: from a stand point of social injustice, it's important to remember that just settling into love is not enough to cure the injustice, and that there are many for which love is not an easy option. But from an individual stand point, it's important to remember that love \ncan\n help you, heal you, and bring you peace."}, {"blog_name": "loraecreates", "id": 683747283244924928, "date": "2022-05-09 04:57:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1652072222, "tags": ["ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZzhgeSbzA8WDyy00", "note_count": 0, "body": "it\u2019s very funny to me that in the subtitles, it says  \u201cCaptain Stede\u201d and not \u201cCaptain Bonnet\u201d "}, {"blog_name": "fxckhaus", "id": 683417296185720832, "date": "2022-05-05 13:32:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1651757522, "tags": ["i think the mental imagery of izzy being in the room right next to stede and ed and just freaking the fuck out is very funny", "ofmd", "music", "rammstein"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z5oYsXbx-6ZqWW00", "note_count": 1, "body": "Puppe is my new rammstein izzy song.

Fang and Ivan! a Samoan man and a Punjabi man\nand so it's like. why the fuck would Ed trust Izzy in the first place? \nbecause the thing is, right, from what we see of Izzy and Ed's relationship in the first four or something episodes of OFMD, like, let's examine their relationship\nthe Blackbeard persona is a constructed artifice - a fuckery\nEdward performs the role, but it's Izzy that maintains it when Ed is in one of his depressions or in a mood - it's Izzy that's out on deck or representing Blackbeard when Ed himself isn't available\nIzzy \nknows Ed doesn't kill\n. not only does he know that Ed doesn't kill, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with it - and he never even asks why or implies he knows why. he just offers to kill people for Ed to make things easier on him\nIzzy mentions Ed's increasingly \"erratic moods\" when he resigns, but initially he's really gentle and cordial with Ed in private, nudging him toward what \nhe\n thinks Ed should do (and lying to try to avoid Stede), but never like, giving orders or trying to argue with him\nit's undeniable that Izzy sees Ed as the commander between them, and while Izzy has a toxic caretaker thing going on where he thinks he knows best, he also considers himself the facilitator of Ed's will and does as he says even when he hates it\nEd does lie and say he's going to get rid of Stede to keep Izzy with him, but he \nalso\n says shit like \"need you here.\" when he taps Izzy's hip and shows other like, variations of vulnerability and trust and expresses his reliance on Izzy\nwhich all raises the question like.\nwhy? why \nIzzy\n?\npart of how painful it is when Izzy goes for Ed and waves that page around and says how Ed needs to embrace his savagery and whatever like... it is that Izzy's not brown. Izzy has no idea what it's like to be Ed, he has no idea what it is to be M\u0101ori, what it is to be brown amongst racist white people\nso why do they have such an intimacy in the first place? of all the people on Ed's ship (of all the people in the world), why is it Izzy to whom he extends this trust of his false identity, and also the vulnerability behind it? because it's not just that he's trusting Izzy with the vulnerability behind his mask, like\nhe's trusting Izzy to \nserve\n him, which Izzy does. he's trusting Izzy to be \nloyal\n to him, and to care for him, which in his pathetic mildly rabid way, he very much does - yes, he's possessive and he's jealous and he's violent and he's cruel, but \nbefore\n we see more of that, like, they're very intimate friends\nthe stupid (and fucking racist) reading of this is the assumption that like... ed's chosen izzy because his ~whiteness~ makes him special and magic and more respectable or whatever, or that because izzy's white, that means he's more likely to read and write or whatever, but like... obviously that's bullshit. izzy's not magically more likely to be able to read and write because he's white - literacy rates were all over the place, but were chaotic among the lower classes, and it's just racist af to be like \"Ohhh izzy and lucius can read bc they're white!\" when like\nlucius can read bc he's not a fucking sailor, he can read because stede looked for a guy who can read. as for why izzy can read (but finds the actual space given to the books perverse), it's probably bc he does the books as first mate - most sailors wouldn't \nneed\n to be able to read bc they've kind of got other shit to be getting on with\nand while there's an argument to be made for like... izzy can \"legitimise\" ed while acting as his agent, and associate with racist white people on ed's behalf or whatever bc he's white, like. not to bully izzy again but i feel like literally any other white guy in existence might be better for that given his whole, you know. personality\nand if ed needs a pet white guy to offer legitimacy to other people or whatever (which frankly i think is lowkey bullshit in the first place, bc Ed's got a reputation and a skillset and \ninfamy\n, Izzy is just a no-name weirdo, white or not), he doesn't actually have to trust him with the mental illness he's struggling with behind closed doors, his suicidal ideation, his whimsy, any of it, but he does\nhe's a M\u0101ori\u00a0man in an unbelievably racist world, struggling not just with the way other people attack and undercut him because of his class and because of his race, but also with the huge vulnerability of his own mental illness and suicidal ideation, and yet the man with whom he is \nclosest\n, the man with whom he is most vulnerable before stede, is izzy hands. \nour idea of whiteness in the modern era has been constructed to uphold the racial supremacy of our whiteness, just used as a violent cudgel to uphold anti-Blackness and anti-indigneous sentiments, as well as other forms of violent racism, within the imperial structure, and the line of \nwhiteness\n and what it extends to has changed many times\nif you look at writings from the 1700s on Jews, on Irish and Scots, on various other ethinic groups, you'll see lots of hugely abusive racial shit that nowadays is brushed aside or is less significant because like... Italians, Jews, Greeks, Irish, those are all mostly accepted as white now, right? \nat the time, not so much\nso yes, like... i think for a lot of people who read Izzy as Irish or as Jewish like, that definitely adds to his potential for racial awareness and the interplay of racial dynamics? but it's not just about the racialism as it is also about class, and the way that like\nwhiteness as a construct today is a weapon used to defend white imperviousness to criticism and white powers over those of anybody else, to create subclasses within classes - upholding whiteness is generally more important to white people as a whole than any kind of genuine allyship with BIPOC simply bc like. we often claim ignorance of our whiteness or the impact of it bc it makes us feel sad :( aw poor baby us so sad about like, the structures that are literally built to keep us in power, often while maintaining the illusion of our ignorance\nlike, one of the things that makes intimate friendship with us so difficult is that we have to unlearn a lot of the behaviours that we're taught from childhood to rank our whiteness over anything else, including the pretence that we don't know we're white, and that includes taking like, other people's race personally, forcing anyone with an examined racial identity (which includes the experience of racism) to be silent in case it makes us ~uncomfortable~ etc\nand even across intersections of other identity, like, we as white people are \nnotorious\n for pretending we understand but being violent and super reactive as soon as anyone else points out racist shit - queer and trans people know that cishets are Uncomfortable and Weird in unspoken ways, but we'll still pretend we don't see the same thing with racism, for example\nand like. have you seen izzy. i love him he's my chewtoy and he's literally kind of the worst guy in the world, but ed trusts him??? which is so \nloaded\n?\nand i'm so so curious and so interested about the things that could prompt Ed to trust Izzy, and what this implies about their history together and their relationship bc like\nin order for Ed to trust Izzy so much, surely they must have talked about it? or surely like, for \nwhatever reason\n, Ed must have some reason to think that Izzy is more aware of the (racist) facts of life than someone else? or less caring of them, less invested in them? \nor\n like... Izzy is his only option, in which case, why was he the only option? \nbecause it's like. it's not just that Izzy and Ed are friends, it's that Izzy is in Ed's service, unassailably (even after getting defeated in a duel and kicked out and he betrays them to the navy, he does so out of his misplaced, obsessive, weird loyalty to Ed and desire to protect him). izzy's devoted to ed, and more specifically, he's like... fixated on ed's survival, even over his own\nso if Izzy is Irish or Jewish or otherwise outside of like, the accepted position of White Man in the period, for whatever reason lacks the relative invulnerability of whiteness or lacks the ability to wield it in polite society or whatever, that adds to it\ni think that either way there's obviously some level of class informing it just in that like... when izzy says they have to be violent and terrible and blah blah, he believes that because he does think it's their only option, and he's disgusted with stede because like\ni think that just as ed has been taunted with ideas of luxury and the idea that they're not for him, he's been told they're not for him again and again and again in a thousand different ways, because he's M\u0101ori, because he's mixed race, because he grew up poor, because because because, like\nizzy?? for whatever reason also has this kind of idea in his head? but for him it's that luxury and softness will make him weak (and therefore destroy his survival), and i think that there's a lot you can play with there, whether it's growing up poor and in poverty, in the navy where that class interplay was pushed so much between commissioned and noncom officers etc, whether it's because he's Jewish or Irish or whatever\nLIKE THERE'S\na lot of potential there, and i'm just fascinated by it, bc Ed is such a vulnerable man and he struggles so much, he's in so much pain - all this trauma and all this agony and all this grief, but it's Izzy that he picks to soothe him? what about Izzy is soothing except for his ferocious loyalty, and like... \nwhy\n is he that loyal in the first place?\ni just! i lose my mind"}, {"blog_name": "katharrop90", "id": 683709118718050304, "date": "2022-05-08 18:50:26 GMT", "timestamp": 1652035826, "tags": ["our flag means death", "blackbeard", "edward teach"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZaHg1Sbz1T8kue00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Question - who does Blackbeard's voice during Pete's story at the beginning of Episode 2?

Like Stede is a light that needs to\nrescue Ed from the dark. And jarring with that use of the imagery made me\nrealise that I see these symbols completely differently, not in opposition but\nin parallel. To me it follows that if the kraken is Ed at his worst, then the\nlighthouse is Stede at his worst.\nIt\u2019s easy to see the negative attributes of a kraken\n(frightening, violent), but the negative attributes of a lighthouse are less\nstraightforward (yes, you can get smashed on the rocks, but what exactly does\nthat tell us about \nStede?\n).\nWhen I considered it, it brought to mind the apocryphal tale\nwhere two nations are in contact by radio at sea. They each demand the other\ndivert to avoid collision, going back and forth until one country says \u201cThis\nis the biggest, most heavily armed warship in our country\u2019s big and heavily\narmed fleet. We demand that you divert course or we will fire upon you,\u201d at\nwhich point the other country says \u201cThis is a lighthouse. Your call.\u201d\nA lighthouse is not going to divert course to avoid a\ncollision. It\u2019s going to stay exactly where it is, and if you don\u2019t divert course\nto accommodate for it, you\u2019re fucked. A lighthouse is a perfect metaphor for obstinance, for inflexibility. Stede can be bad at taking other people\u2019s perspectives\ninto account and adjusting accordingly. At his worst, he can\u2019t even take\nin that other people\u2019s perspectives may differ from his in the first place.\nWe see this with his family. He wants to uproot their lives\nand go to sea. He presents his dream as a present to Mary, and assumes she will\nbe just as thrilled as he is, because he\u2019s too wrapped up in his own excitement\nto connect with Mary as a separate individual. The dialogue then explicitly\ntells us how Stede is unwilling/unable to hear Mary expressing her perspective/experience:\nMary: \"You know I hate the ocean. I said so just the\nother day.\"\nStede: \"What? When?\"\nMary: \"When we were standing by the \nfucking ocean\n.\"\nMary isn\u2019t upset that Stede has an interest in sailing, she is upset\nthat Stede has no interest in actually knowing her, merely trying to fit her\ninto his own interests. The scene where Mary repeatedly tries to get Stede\u2019s\nattention and he \u2018Mmm\u2019s without looking up from his book also show us how he\ndoes not respond to her attempts to communicate. It\u2019s telling that when she\npresents her anniversary present to him, Stede does not know Mary paints.\n(Honestly, I would find it completely in character for Stede if she had\nmentioned her painting to him several times in the past, but he just hadn\u2019t\ntaken it in because it\u2019s not what he\u2019s interested in.)\nWhich takes us to the consequence of this inflexibility: the\nlighthouse is isolated. Stede is so inflexible at times that he cannot forge\nthe back-and-forth communication required to actually connect with other\nhumans.\nWe also see this at the start of the show with his crew. I\nthink the underlying reason that the crew wants to mutiny is how\nStede cannot see things from their perspectives or accomodate for them.\nStede went into piracy with no experience, and decided to\nimpose his own views on how to do things on his crew, without seeking to first\nlearn from them about an area in which he has no experience. Throughout\nthe first few episodes we see Stede trying to push his crew into being the people he\nexpects and wants them to be, rather than trying to get to know them.\nIn the first episode, in the \u2018talk it through as crew\u2019 call\nand response, we see Stede \n(frankly, quite\npatronisingly)\n\ntrying to push the crew into adopting his\nperspective and participate the way he wants them to. We hear Stede narrate \"I pay my crew a salary. Same wage,\nevery week, no matter what. Course, it took them a while to come 'round to the\nidea\", and while Stede probably thinks he\u2019s doing what\u2019s best for them and\nthey just can\u2019t understand that, consider what difference it makes to the\npower dynamics if the results of\neveryone\u2019s work are shared versus if they are completely dependant on Stede. Consider\nhow Stede is disbelieving when Lucius says he\u2019s the only crew member who can\nread (\"That's not. Is that true?\"), dismissing this input to\nthe point that a couple of episodes later, when he tries to replace Lucius with\nFrenchie, he is surprised to discover Frenchie cannot write.\nWhen Stede decides that the crew should vacation in episode\ntwo, he says explicitly \"Your time is yours to do with as you please\"\nand \"There's literally no way to mess this up.\" He then almost\nimmediately starts telling the crew what they can and can\u2019t do, responding to\ntheir methods of unwinding with \"That is NOT what I was talking\nabout!\". You\u2019re not allowed to spend your downtime roughhousing, becasue Stede does not enjoy roughhousing. Stede\u2019s preconception of himself as a captain is that he is\naccepting and he listens, but the actuality of his captaining style is that he\ntries to push his crew into complying with his preferences.\nIn the third episode, Stede is completely unwilling to learn\nfrom his crew \u2013 most of whom have visited the Pirate Republic before \u2013 about\nhow things work there. When Lucius tries to advise him (repeatedly) he\ndismisses it (repeatedly).\nIf the kraken represents a toxic masculinity aligned with aggressive and threatening behaviour, then the lighthouse represents a toxic masculinity aligned with is mansplaining, blind\nconfidence and the assumption of authority.\nIn episode four, their meeting starts Stede and Ed\u2019s arc of\nmutual character development. I think it\u2019s a crucial moment in Stede\u2019s\ndevelopment when he excitedly presents Ed with Stede\u2019s preconception of who Ed\nis \u2013 a picture of Blackbeard from one of his pirate books \u2013 and Stede actually\nsees and takes in Ed\u2019s response. Stede listens to Ed. And after having listened,\nStede adjusts his course. While Stede\u2019s perspective is firmly that being\nBlackbeard would be great (he says that he\u2019d give up everything for just a day\nof being Blackbeard), what he says to Ed isn\u2019t encouragement to keep going,\ninsisting that surely Ed\u2019s life is amazing. Instead, it\u2019s: \"Look. I can't\nbelieve I'm saying this, but have you ever considered retirement?\" This\nmight be the first moment in the show where Stede is considering things from\nsomeone else\u2019s perspective. And that\u2019s the start of him being able to reach\npast his previous isolation and actually connect.\nStede still struggles at times with seeing past himself for the rest of the show, but episode four is a turning point.\nIt introduces his capacity to change and a new willingness to learn. \nFor the rest of the show, we see Stede succeed when he stops\ntrying to be the isolated beacon that gives detached direction, when he can see\npast his preconceptions, connect and adjust, and we see him fail when he can\u2019t.\nIn episode five his moment of triumph is rooted in a moment of connecting with\nand listening to Frenchie. When Frenchie expresses his experience \u2013 \u201cI was in\nservice for a minute so I now the lay of the land and trust me, servants, they\nsee everything. This lot, they're not so fancy\u201d \u2013 Stede actually takes it in,\nand that gives him the idea to ask Abshir for the information that Stede\nbuilds into his passive aggression bomb. In episode six Stede comes pretty\nclose to explicitly naming the problem and solution himself: \"I'd like to\napologise for my behaviour earlier. As total as my theatrical knowledge may be,\nI did forget the most important thing: company!\" \nI think what takes the crew from where they started at the\nbrink of mutiny, to the intense loyalty they have by the end, is not a change\nof heart on their part, but Stede changing. Stede softening his dismissive streak,\nstarting to genuinely rather than superficially listen to his crew and to respect\ntheir input.\nWhen Stede feels he needs to be the lighthouse, he feels he must\nbe the guiding light all on his own. He can\u2019t have his guidance questioned, because\nthen he\u2019s failing in his role. \nI think this sense that\u00a0\u2018knowing best\u2019 is supposed to fall entirely to him is one of the reasons why he feels\nso guilty about leaving Mary: he is supposed to be her guiding light, so surely\nwithout him she must be lost? Surely, without his light, his family have been\nsmashed up against the rocks? It is his sense that he has failed in his duties\nat being his family\u2019s lighthouse that makes him falter at the crucial moment\nwhen he leaves Ed. Stede seeing that actually, his family are just fine at\nfinding their own direction (and Stede finally, finally, listening to and allowing himself to be changed by Mary) is what shows him that he doesn\u2019t have to be the\nlighthouse. \nI don\u2019t think he returns to his crew as a guiding light. I\nthink he returns ready to adjust course as he goes, with his crew\u2019s support and collaboration."}, {"blog_name": "alas-poor-cesario", "id": 683596762140868608, "date": "2022-05-07 13:04:34 GMT", "timestamp": 1651928674, "tags": ["ofmd", "wip", "lucius x izzy"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZFJOqxbydw8X0u00", "note_count": 2, "body": "Last line of my most recent WIP:\n\"It's l\u00e1imh not 'layve'.

Pete would\u2019ve loved to help Lucius, but his pickpocketing skill left little room for contribution. Lucius insisted he try some of those \u201corduvers\u201d while he worked. So Pete grabbed something off the table and did his best to keep a low profile. Given how acquainted Lucius seemed with this environment, he should be fine.\nLucius was indeed fine\u2013if he didn\u2019t count what he\u2019d actually come for. He subtly brushed by every verdant-coloured guest, hand sneaking in and out of their pockets before they could blink, but he either came up empty or with a jewel that didn\u2019t belong to Izzy. He didn\u2019t exactly feel bad about robbing the wrong people, though. He was a pirate for a reason.\nGood thing Izzy had managed to identify the culprit somewhat, or he\u2019d be at this for ages. Lucius approached the next sucker in green and carefully reached his hand out.\nNot carefully enough.\nThe man turned around just when he\u2019d relieved him of his possession. Lucius froze, fingers clenched on his prize. Had he been caught?\nHe had been caught.\nThe other teens were laughing at him. Pointing. Yelling. Mocking.\n\u201cLook! It\u2019s the faggot!\u201d\n\u201cFaggot! Faggot! Faggot!\u201d\nThe laughter dissipated and Lucius was back on the cruise ship. An adult man with a powdered face observed him in confusion, but not accusation. He hadn\u2019t noticed the theft. Lucius was safe.\n\u201cAh\u2013er\u2013 Good day to you.\u201d He gave a quick greeting and got the hell away from there. Once he was at a safe distance, Lucius opened his hand. Izzy\u2019s ring lay in his palm. Thank goodness. He got what he came for. Now he and Pete could leave and he wouldn\u2019t have to think about\u2013\n\u201c\nLucius\n!\u201d\nHe petrified on the spot. That was his mother. He didn\u2019t know how, but she\u2019d found him. There was nowhere to hide. She was going to scold him. She was going to tell him what a disappointment and a shame to the family he was. Maybe even slap him if the mood struck her. Lucius never knew. She was unpredictable.\nHe slowly turned his head and only found a bunch of rich people chattering happily. One was being addressed as \u201cLucien\u201d. They weren\u2019t looking at him. His mother was nowhere to be found.\nOh, god. Lucius\u2019s strides were even faster now. This wasn\u2019t good. He actually thought his mother was here. Of course she wasn\u2019t; she was miles away, doing god-knows-what in her fancy mansion. There was no one here who knew him. Lucius had no reason to be afraid.\nSo why was it that all eyes were suddenly on him? Every person he passed seemed to take notice. They laughed and pointed, just like his peers had. They whispered and gossiped and he heard his mother again, listing reason after reason she was ashamed to have had him. He never did anything right. His efforts were never good enough. He was ugly, and stupid, and he only had himself to blame for his lack of friends.\nLucius tried to ignore the voices, but they weighed on him like an anchor. He was still moving, but he was slowing. He pushed himself through the crowd, which consisted of blurry, featureless silhouettes at this point. The door seemed to shrink away the closer he got. His chest hurt. His breathing was heavy and uneven. He wasn\u2019t getting enough air.\u00a0\nHe had to get out of here \nnow\n.\n-\nPete had just exited a rather uncomfortable conversation. Some nobles had recognised him as one half of the \u201c\nerotic dancers\n\u201d and were eager to learn more about them. As soon as he\u2019d opened his mouth, though, their enthusiasm faded, and they no longer seemed interested. They couldn\u2019t excuse themselves with some bullshit reason fast enough.\nPete scoffed, but perked up when he saw a head of familiar black curls move in his direction.\n\u201cHey, babe. Listen to this: I think these people don\u2019t like my lisp\u2013\u201d\nThe words died in his throat. Lucius\u2019s face was paler than ever. He was wheezing and sweating and on the verge of crying.\n\u201cLucius\u2013\u201d Pete grabbed him by the shoulders, eyes wide in worry. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cPete\u2013\u201d The tears started rolling down his cheeks. \u201cGet me out of here\u2013I\u2019m scared\u2013\u201d\nPete had no idea what the hell was going on, but he wasn\u2019t going to waste time asking. He lifted his boyfriend in his arms and headed for the entrance, barking at every obstacle to get out of his fucking way. Etiquette be damned.\nPete put Lucius down once they were back on deck. He hoped the fresh air would do him good, but his face screamed panic and anguish no less than before.\n\u201cPete\u2013\u201d Lucius was clutching his own chest in despair. He sounded so frail and small. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me\u2013? I can\u2019t breathe\u2013Am I dying?\u201d\nTruth be told, Pete had no idea. He was struggling not to freak out himself. Asking Lucius for details felt counterproductive. What seemed most important right now was returning his breath to a steady rhythm. He could help with that, at least.\n\u201cSit down.\u201d Pete knelt in front of Lucius and clasped his hands tightly in his own. He forced himself to sound firm, but not angry. \u201cLook at me\u2013look at me, sweetie. That\u2019s right. Now take a deep breath with your nose\u2026 and let it out through your mouth. Slowly.\u201d\nLucius followed his example. \u201cMy body\u2019s tingling all over,\u201d he whimpered.\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s okay. Keep breathing the way I told you. In\u2026 and out.\u201d\nLucius obeyed a couple of times, but then he whined: \u201cIt\u2019s not working\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is\u2013eyes up here, baby. That\u2019s it.\u201d Pete attempted his most comforting smile when Lucius\u2019s eyes wavered back to him. \u201cDon\u2019t think about how you\u2019re feeling. How about we sing a song?\u201d\n\u201cS-sing a song\u2013?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Y\u2019know, that love song Frenchie sang the other day? Remember how it goes?\u201d\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s sing it together.\u201d Pete took it upon himself to begin. He couldn\u2019t sing for shit, but what mattered was nudging Lucius into joining in.\nEventually, Lucius did so. The words came out in between shallow breaths, but the longer they sang, the more they overtook his gasps for air. He finally returned Pete\u2019s grip on his hands as they chanted together. They repeated the song a couple of times before Lucius could comfortably stop. His breathing was steady and a healthy glow had returned to his cheeks.\n\u201cOh, thank god,\u201d he whispered, and he pulled Pete into a grateful hug. He\u2019d stopped crying, but he was so glad to not feel like he was dying that the tears threatened to overflow again.\nPete hugged him back, relieved the ordeal was over. He couldn\u2019t describe how much the idea of losing Lucius frightened him. \u201cThank god\u201d was exactly what he thought.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\u201cBetter.\u201d\n\u201cAny pain?\u201d\n\u201cNone.\u201d\nPete looked at him in mild disbelief. Lucius had looked so agonised before. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cReally.\u201d Lucius shrugged, smiling meekly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really hurting to begin with. It\u2019s hard to describe. I just felt\u2026 extremely unpleasant.\u201d\n\u201cDid someone say something to you?\u201d\nLucius shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine, babe. Thanks to you. And\u2013\u201d He held up something shiny. \u201c\u2013even got Izzy\u2019s ring. Plus some other stuff, but who\u2019s counting, right?\u201d\nPete was unconvinced. In all honesty, Izzy\u2019s ring was the last thing he cared about right now. \u201cBabe, I don\u2019t want to pry, but\u2013you were \ncrying\n. If someone hurt you, I\u2019ll\u2013\u201d\n\u201cSweetie, it\u2019s okay, really.\u201d Lucius placed his hands on Pete\u2019s chest. In his eyes was something akin to despair. \u201cLet\u2019s just go, all right? Please?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t have to tell him twice. Pete had no qualms with leaving this goddamn place. He didn\u2019t like being left in the dark, but he knew Lucius wasn\u2019t ready to share. He might be later\u2013and if he wasn\u2019t, he\u2019d have to make peace with that.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Pete kept his hands close to Lucius as they rose, just in case he needed help standing. He was glad to see he didn\u2019t. \u201cHow about a nice, hot bath when we get back, huh? I\u2019ll wash your hair.\u201d\nLucius nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Pete said. \u201cJust got one last thing to take care of. Give me those trinkets, would ya?\u201d\nLucius was puzzled, but did as he asked. Pete headed back inside for a moment. When he returned, his hands were empty.\n-\nThey wasted little time on Izzy\u2019s happy reunion with his ring. Lucius gave it back to him without so much as a smirk, which visibly threw him off. Pete could tell he was wondering what had happened aboard that ship, but thankfully, he was too awkward to ask outright. Wouldn\u2019t want to imply interest in Lucius\u2019s wellbeing, of course.\nThey knocked on the door to the Captain\u2019s Quarters. Both captains were inside, one reading to the other. Stede sat on the couch while Edward used his lap as a cushion. Shameless rascal didn\u2019t even move when they walked in. Stede was slightly taken aback by Pete\u2019s request to use his tub, but he consented.\n\u201cCome on, Ed,\u201d Pete heard him say while they made for the bathroom. \u201cLet\u2019s give them some privacy.\u201d As clueless as he was, even Stede seemed to have picked up on the bleakness on Lucius\u2019s face. He hadn\u2019t hyperventilated since Pete helped him calm down. Whatever happened before that must still be weighing on his mind.\nSince Stede\u2019s tub could only fit one person, Pete let Lucius go first. Even without the heart attack-inducing conclusion to their errand, he deserved it for a job well done. Pete had done little more than accompany him.\nOnce Lucius had dipped all but his head underneath the bubbles, Pete poured some oil in his hand and started working on his hair. It was oddly quiet\u2013almost unnervingly so. Neither Pete nor Lucius was the type to soak in silence. Pete wondered if Lucius would let him ask about today. He didn\u2019t know whether keeping quiet or speaking up was the right choice.\n\u201c... Pete\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nPete was so surprised his hands almost froze, but then he resumed. \u201cFor what, babe? If it\u2019s the breathing thing\u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo, not that. For dragging you to the party. I used you.\u201d\nPete frowned. \u201cNo idea what you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about. Sure, it was for shitty uppity people, but I had fun.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t act in your best interest, or Izzy\u2019s. All I could think of was mine.\u201d Lucius turned around and Pete could see the regret on his face. \u201cMy family may not be as wealthy as Stede\u2019s, but we\u2019re still nobility. I hated that lifestyle and everything it entailed, so I left, just like him. But then, when Izzy gave me the chance to revisit it\u2026 I took it. I wanted to walk in there with my head held high, prove to them\u2013to myself\u2013that I\u2019d made the right choice. I wanted you on my arm so I could say: \u201cWatch me dance with my boyfriend. You can\u2019t do a thing about it. We\u2019re fucking right under your noses \u2018cause we don\u2019t give a shit what you think. You can\u2019t crush who I am anymore.\u201d\u201d Lucius lowered his head in shame. \u201cAll I did was tout you around like some shiny toy. You deserve better than that. You\u2019re always so good to me, Pete, but I\u2013\u201d\n\u201cHey, hey, hey.\u201d Pete lifted his chin so he could give him a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not angry at you. Hell, if I helped you rise above those fuckers, I\u2019m even a little proud.\u201d\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s what happened in the end. I was reminded of before, and I thought I heard my mom, and\u2013\u201d Lucius squeezed his eyes shut. It wasn\u2019t enough to keep the tears inside. \u201c... I was her passion project. She tried to mould me into the perfect son. I was punished for every single little misstep. I was taught to be neat, and quiet, and obedient. I actually tried to please her by being a good son, hoping that would earn her approval.\u201d\nAs if to answer him, her voice echoed in his head again. It cut through his heart, as always.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where I went wrong with Lucius, honestly. That child doesn\u2019t even have a personality!\u201d\nWhen he overheard that, Lucius decided her approval no longer mattered. It started with a little pickpocketing; just a single act of defiance. But gradually, the real Lucius came out: he dressed like he wanted, acted like he wanted, and loved men like he wanted. But such conduct would never coincide with the way of the aristocrats. In the end, he had to choose between conditional love and his own happiness.\nHappiness it was.\n\u201c... but she\u2019s still here, in my head,\u201d Lucius pointed. \u201cI\u2013I thought I was stronger than that. I thought I\u2019d left that pain behind. It\u2013it\u2019s scary, knowing it\u2019s still so close.\u201d\n\u201cSweetie\u2026\u201d Pete caressed his cheek. \u201cWhen you\u2019re here on the ship, do you ever feel afraid?\u201d\n\u201cPlenty of times.\u201d\n\u201cI mean of your past.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lucius thought about it. \u201c... I suppose I don\u2019t, no.\u201d\nPete smiled. \u201cThen it\u2019s simple. No more parties for you.\u201d\nLucius\u2019s forehead wrinkled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in still having some attachment to your old life. I\u2019m sure we all do. But it\u2019s important that we leave it where it belongs, especially if it hurts us.\u201d Pete laid his free hand on Lucius\u2019s other cheek, looking right into his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want you to hurt yourself like that again, Lucius. Seeing you like that\u2013it broke my heart.\u201d His face was reddening as he spoke. \u201cYou have people who care about you now. You don\u2019t need to prove yourself anymore.\u201d\nHis words left Lucius completely speechless. He just stared at Pete with big, wet eyes, lip trembling. Pete gave him a sympathetic smile as he wiped his tears with his thumbs. When Lucius leaned forward to kiss him, he kissed back.\n\u201cNo man has ever been as sweet to me as you, Pete,\u201d Lucius whispered after he\u2019d finally broken away. The smile on his face was actually a little shy: a rare sight.\nPete winked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018cause you deserve it, babe.\u201d He put his hands on top of Lucius\u2019s, which were resting on the edge of the tub, and gave a soft squeeze.\u00a0\n-\nThe sun was setting on a calm evening. The crew were gathering on deck for Stede\u2019s bedtime story. Lucius was already tucked under his blanket, waiting for Pete to join him. He was tired after today and looking forward to falling asleep in his beautiful boyfriend\u2019s arms.\nBefore Stede was even outside, though, the men (and Jim) were startled by several consecutive blasts. In the distance, the aristocrats\u2019 ship exploded. Lights had been bright in the windows, indicating the party was still going strong. So much for that.\nEverybody, Lucius included, gathered at the rail to witness the sinking wreck. The remaining members, as well as the co-captains, ran outside, equally shaken by the noise.\n\u201cWho fired the bloody cannons?\u201d Blackbeard grumbled, but no one had an answer. Not even Pete, who answered with a shrug. His hands were behind his back and covered in gunpowder. He caught Izzy looking in his direction. The first mate said nothing. When he averted his eyes, Pete threw a smirk at what remained of the ship. If he listened closely, he could hear screaming.\nThat\u2019s what they got for making his boyfriend cry.\n-\nIn a far-off dinghy, a group of servants were watching the chaos as well. The one Pete had approached shortly before his and Lucius\u2019s departure had been wise to listen to his warning: \u201cGet your mates out of here. This ship is going to be destroyed.\u201d\nHe and his comrades had made it out in time. They were laughing and cheering, celebrating their freedom, but Pete had done more than given them their lives back. With the stolen jewellery safely in their pockets, they could start anew."}, {"blog_name": "baseballmomchaosflirt", "id": 683652964995497984, "date": "2022-05-08 03:57:54 GMT", "timestamp": 1651982274, "tags": ["ofmd", "yes here I am again", "I\u2019ve gotta be on the double digits on the rewatches now"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z_GZNybyqh-WCm00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Blackbeard with his long pipe grumbling, \u201clove that\u201d"}, {"blog_name": "bug-puppy", "id": 683432238207123456, "date": "2022-05-05 17:29:32 GMT", "timestamp": 1651771772, "tags": ["ofmd", "izzy hands", "ofmd fic"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zv4x2Tby2V-gOi00", "note_count": 7, "body": "CAN PEOPLE PLEASE LEAVE LINKS TO FICS IN THE COMMENTS WHERE IZZY IS SOFT OR WHERE THE CREW AND OR ED AND STEDE ARE NICE TO HIM (Just Izzy fics that are soft) "}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683660762827341824, "date": "2022-05-08 06:01:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1651989710, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbysTTpCa00", "note_count": 1, "body": "always seeking (however scary)\nby \nShowMeAHero\n\u201cLet\u2019s get him out of those wet clothes, then, hm?\u201d Ed suggests.\nStede hesitates, then draws backward to look into Izzy\u2019s eyes, all bright and curious and concerned and tender and\u2014 \nJesus motherfucking Christ\u2014\n\u201cWould that be something you wanted?\u201d Stede asks him.\nSay it, say it, say it,\n Izzy tells himself. \nYou\u2019re better than this.

I\u2019ve already babbled about Izzy as Navy. The more I think about it, the more likely I think he was inching up the ranks because look how buttoned-down his clothing is. Most general workie-sailors were more casual in their dress because they didn\u2019t need to impress anyone. But look to the officers and you will see them dressing up, collars closed, cravats tied, groomed and polished up. He also has skill with a sword that suggests at least some degree of training, especially his stances. \nIf this is the case, this definitely nudges Izzy into being educated enough to get himself into the upper ranks, even if he had to work many times as hard to get there than the fancy pants gentlemen who were just handed their ranks. Plus let\u2019s not forget that when he contacts the Navy to sell Stede out to them, he is able to make direct contact with an Admiral. He is not only able to negotiate to get Blackbeard - most infamous pirate in the Caribbean - released to his custody but is given the rank of Captain of a ship. Why would they give a First Mate captaincy if he didn\u2019t have known credentials? \nI\u2019d dispute the fact that knowing the word perverse means he\u2019s educated because honestly? Churches up and down the country would scream about perversions at any time of the day or night. I\u2019ve read so many church records detail perverse and licentious lusts and things like that. Depending on where he came from, people may have been slut-shamed in front of the church because some of them did that to keep their folk in line.\nHOWEVER\nHowever, the way and location that he uses the word just donked me on the head with a thought. Something or someone Stede-shaped did damage so significant to Izzy that he would willingly sell himself into the service of the Crown to prevent the same thing happening to Ed. \nAt first he simply sees Stede as an embarrassment and a joke, but I just realised how much more visibly murdery Izzy becomes when they have their confrontation in Jackie\u2019s, when the \u2018Gentleman Pirate\u2019 had his regional debut. \nIt got me thinking that if Izzy \ndid\n previously have someone who he cared about - the owner of that ring - it would have been a hell of a problem in the Navy. Yes people did get away with liaisons but if this was something serious, the people in charge of handling it would have been the officers, most of whom would have been Gentlemen of some sort or other.\nIt makes me think that somewhere in his past, someone - who probably considered themselves Izzy\u2019s \u2018better\u2019 on account of breeding, standing and education - used that word to describe the owner of Izzy\u2019s ring. Who used his books and laws and education and clever little words in his fancy room to destroy someone Izzy cared about.\nHim calling the library perverse is not just a reflection on Stede, but on his wealth, his class, his privilege, his stupid words in his stupid books. It\u2019s hate by association because he\u2019s seen what those kind of people can do without even stopping or thinking about it.\nAnd Izzy is damned if he\u2019s going to let some other twat just like those people do the same to Ed."}, {"blog_name": "bzedan", "id": 683480949194899456, "date": "2022-05-06 06:23:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1651818226, "tags": ["meche chatters", "ofmd related", "our flag means death", "I will only ever be vague about what I do for work but please imagine a lot of spreadsheets and personal opinions on network behaviour", "know I typed this then made le corna because I am an superstitious optimist"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZyoeaybyDarJWa00", "note_count": 21, "body": "Two HBO Max shows of note (\nMinx\n, \nJulia\n) have had renewal announcements recently, as well as  HBO\u2019s \nWinning Time\n, and yet OFMD has not however here is my loose theory, built on watching how TV has handled itself over the past couple of years through day job:\nJulia\u2019s\n second season was a given, it\u2019s  a version of what mama HBO does as far as dramatised history, with a notable cast about a known person. It was either going to fail quickly and quietly or get us a second season.\nMinx\n is for a particular audience and is popular enough with great reviews, you renew that but it\u2019s not something you need to make a showpiece in doing. \nWinning Time \nhad its renewal dropped in midst of a news cycle about the people portrayed on it complaining about the show, that\u2019s a gimmie, you use momentum to get people to finish the season. \nAs per \nSamba Schutte\u2019s Insta stories today\n, HBO Max is releasing the OFMD season 1 soundtrack is dropping tomorrow, May 6 (\npress release\n). \nEdited to add\n that lol I\u2019m PST and it\u2019s out already and is only 19 minutes but glorious ones (\nSpotify link\n).\nThe stats for demand are of a level that folks I know who have ears closer within the industry say HBO Max has been legitimately blown away by streaming demand and audience response. \nAs I \nmentioned earlier\n, the May 18 upfronts are going to be a big deal this year for Warner Brothers, HBO Max\u2019s parent company\u2019s presentation for advertisers due to their acquisition of Discovery (as well as their upcoming GoT spin-offs etc).\nIf I were in the sort of position HBO Max is I would see a show with a creator with a stated \u201cthree season story,\u201d a sky-high and unflagging demand, an audience who can move social media mountains and has created a physical letter writing campaign, and I would make a meal of it and serve it to advertisers at my fancy presentation. \u201cLook at how much they want what we make, they can\u2019t get enough, we released an official soundtrack, we have baskets of honest-to-god mail, our numbers are beautiful,\u201d I would say and then renew the show for seasons two and three. \nAnd my very superstitious self does not want to type this down, but we all have our special interests to share with others and I am paid to spend my workday tracking television shows and having a weird and wide knowledge of behaviour to make guesses as to what may become popular.\nSo what I can give while I wait for my brain to cycle to making fic and art are my collected observations and, well, industry \nvibes\n. I hope I am right and that this is helpful and hopeful and want to also note that excitedly responding to the album drop and not flagging in our demands for renewal makes our case even stronger than it already is.

It\u2019s about pirates, who are gay. I understand the importance of showing that side of the struggle of coming out and some of the shit that comes with being gay, but when that\u2019s 90% of most mainstream gay media it gets frustrating. It\u2019s important to show gay and trans people in story lines where their character arch isn\u2019t about coming out or where a huge plot line is about homophobia. It\u2019s quite possible it\u2019s the severe internalized homophobia that is taking it\u2019s time leaving me alone, but Having to face that in every piece of media that has representation in it gets frustrating, and it\u2019s rarely as comforting as something where that\u2019s not a part of the plot. For example, evangeline Samos from red queen is important to me bc she\u2019s the first lesbian character I saw while finding myself, her character arch isn\u2019t about being gay, while there is hints of homophobia in the people around her and how they talk to her (her mom). She is there to kickass, learn to relax and love her gf. In the same hand our flag means death is comforting bc I got to watch gay be just be gay. \nOn the same topic can we please get more lesbians. Not side characters or subtly hinted at, not used for the male gaze. I want a bad ass woman solving crime, a princess, a pirate, a normal person, who also just loves her girlfriend. \ufffc"}, {"blog_name": "getmean", "id": 683799780378492928, "date": "2022-05-09 18:51:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1652122288, "tags": ["blackbonnet", "stede bonnet", "edward teach", "our flag means death", "i actually don't know what ship name people are commonly using i'm so far out of the loop i can't even see it on the horizon", "my writing", "this was fun now back to the foot fic"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z0daGybzM4R_yq00", "note_count": 3, "body": "title:\n \nthis heart within me burns\nwords:\n 2408\nrating:\n M\nsummary:\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019ve made me soft,\n he thinks, as he watches Stede notch his thumb in the page Ed had been looking at.

Because Jim is driven by the trauma of seeing their father (and seemingly the rest of their family) killed before their eyes, and then being raised to be well. God's Perfect Killing Machine instead of being raised to process that trauma but still - that guilt of surviving and leaving vengeance unfinished is what drives Jim to leave the crew and go back to the Republic of Pirates and seek vengeance. And they TELL Oluwande that they have to do it, and they're honest about their needs, and Oluwande supports them even when he'd love to be with them. He knows they're leaving, so he can be emotionally prepared and even though he misses them, he can cope and resume his normal life.\nWe can contrast this sharply with Stede and the guilt that haunts him the entire first season - the guilt of abandoning his family in the middle of the night to chase his own dreams. It's a guilt built on a lifetime of bullying and insecurity, and its a huge part of the reason he almost lets Chauncey Badminton murder him, and then retreats home to his old life when instead Chauncey kills himself - because he has been haunted by this guilt and this despair and it is a familiar place and mess and one he feels compelled to fix. \nBut Stede doesn't talk about that guilt, even though it's mentioned directly as early as episode 2, when one of the native elders talks to him. He mentions that he has a family but without specifics and he buries his feelings deep - he shows the signs of it, but he doesn't really talk about it, until it all builds up and he well. Ditches Ed to go home out of a fear of ruining him and out of guilt for \"ruining\" his family (of course we know he didn't ruin his family or Ed but it's about Stede's driving guilt). \nStede runs away, but we see that much like Jim, with his guilt resolved he's running back now. He's coming back to Ed. \nHopefully, he'll get to have a welcome home as tender (eventually). But I think the parallels are there to help us highlight one of the flaws in the early relationship between Blackbonnet so that they can come back together stronger, in the future.

Her mother, Molly, was a famous pirate by the name Piratica and Art, tired of her life and school, decides to find her old crew to return to the seven seas and take after her mother. Her father tries to stop her but ultimately, she gets away and through some Drama evantually finds the crew and return to the seas! But the crew is different from what she remembered, with several of them seasick and not at all as fearsome and brave as in her memories. Turns out they weren't actually real pirates at all, only actors in a famous play. The explosion had been an accident. Art still wants to be a pirate and live up to her mother's legacy, no matter if it was real or not and the crew joins her on her adventure (and if a certain Felix also joins them, first as a prisoner, later as a part of the crew, well that's just a lil treat for Art wink wonk)\nThey even find the treasure!!

THEN COMES THE CONFESSION!! this scene has fr stayed with me for years, far longer than I actually managed to finish the first book. It goes like this; Art, F\u00e9lix and her crew is sentenced to death for piracy. Felix is just about to be hanged (or if it was Art? don't remember exactly but it still got the VIBE) and suddenly Art yells out her love for Felix, in front of the whole audience and everyone gathered there and they're freed!! with a pardon and promise to not go back to the seas (which, obviously Art isn't possible to keep for too long)\nThere are around three? books i think, but I've only read the first two and it's the first one I remember anything at all from (second book is basically Art and Felix is married and Art wants to return to the sea and piracy, or at least \nsailing\n) and apparently I remembered quite a lot anyways fhdbfnbjd"}, {"blog_name": "laszlosharmonica", "id": 683654428420702208, "date": "2022-05-08 04:21:09 GMT", "timestamp": 1651983669, "tags": ["ofmd", "ed ofmd", "izzy ofmd", "ed our flag means death", "incorrect our flag means death quotes", "incorrect quotes", "izzy our flag means death", "blackbeard ofmd", "blackbeard our flag means death", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zn9aqXbyr1IR8u00", "note_count": 14, "body": "Ed: a mental health break does not mean breaking someone's bones Izzy,\nIzzy: but I feel so much better, "}, {"blog_name": "simherewriting", "id": 683273536517832704, "date": "2022-05-03 23:27:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1651620422, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "good omens"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZE7MVUbxUQbCaW00", "note_count": 19, "body": "i can't believe that all these years i read and watched this 'fighting at first sight with visible passion that will turn into love at some point so there is a little hate but faster burn' relationships and decided that i am not a romantic person. all i need was couple guys who thinks they are cool and reckless falling in love so bad that they are ready to risk it all if it means they will spend one more minute with the ones they love. i am a fool for this \"i will stand here by your side and support your enthusiasm about this thing that i have no idea about and i will smile while i am doing it because i love you but don't make it a big deal it is just one big part of the core of my existence\" way of thinking and feeling."}, {"blog_name": "vitruvianwatson", "id": 683604142934114304, "date": "2022-05-07 15:01:53 GMT", "timestamp": 1651935713, "tags": ["but better than that", "ofmd", "our flag means death", "blackbonnet", "edward teach", "stede bonnet"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZHKaxvbyfbYQai00", "note_count": 62, "body": "A Blackbonnet Reunion\nStede: Ed!

Ed\u2019s got a bottle of rum clutched in one hand and Stede\u2019s cravat in the other, and Stede is trying his best to unbuckle Ed\u2019s holster from around his waist before he ends up snagging it on another doorknob. Personally, Ed doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a problem\u2014he\u2019s not drunk enough that he\u2019s stumbling into those walls all on his own, after all, glancing merrily down at his love\u2019s kiss-darkened lips. But alas, he can\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t love the feel of Stede\u2019s arms around his waist, so he graciously puts up with it.\n\u201cWhat a bash!\u201d Stede crows, delighted as he finally dislodges the tongue of his belt from the buckle. \u201cRoach really outdid himself with that cake. Splendid, truly.\u201d\nEd hums his agreement, tugging the cravat up a bit to return Stede\u2019s attention to where it belonged. His co-captain follows willingly, glancing up and pecking him. He can still taste the orange glaze on his smile.\n\u201cThink we\u2019ll have to turn right back around to St. Augustine to make up for all the fruit he probably used,\u201d Ed teases. Stede swats him on the chest, eyes sparkling, and he snickers.\n\u201cHush, you rude thing. I\u2019ll have you know we stocked extra oranges especially for this. After all, it\u2019s not every day that part of our crew gets married!\u201d\nEd smiles wistfully, falling gracelessly into his place on the divan. A recent acquisition from a Dutch ship, but it\u2019s quickly becoming his favorite spot to lounge. He drops the bottle of rum on the floor and closes his eyes, enjoying the slight spin the room takes. From somewhere behind him, he can hear Stede pattering about, the clinking of their crystal set and the splash of what he can only assume is more booze hitting the glass, and he resigns himself to being considerably drunk for the remainder of the evening.\nHe\u2019s seen matelotage ceremonies before, but never one planned and executed by one Stede Bonnet. Once Lucius and Black Pete had announced their intentions, the man had been a flurry of activity, insisting on a lavish (well, as lavish as a pirate ceremony could get, Ed supposes,) affair. But If there\u2019s one thing that he\u2019s learned over the past two years, it\u2019s never to doubt what the man he breathes for is capable of.\nThey\u2019d docked in Havana, and in the span of about a week the deck of the ship was transformed with flowers and ribbon and candles of all colors and sizes. The yards were dripping with garlands, the banisters draped with chiffon and swags. Somewhere Stede had even found an exquisite and impractically long, plush red carpet to run the length of the main deck for an aisle. Lucius had cried when he\u2019d emerged from below deck to see it.\nThe ceremony had been held at sunset when the stifling summer air was a bit less oppressive, and the sky was painted a swath of pinks and purples. The humid air was perfumed heavily with the bountiful flowers, and if anyone asks, that\u2019s why Ed\u2019s eyes were watery during the ceremony. Absolutely nothing to do with the heartfelt vows Lucius had recited, or the look of utter adoration that shined on Pete\u2019s face. They showered the couple in rose petals as they ran down the aisle (\nno rice\n\u2014Buttons had insisted that it hurt Olivia\u2019s stomach,) and then the following hours were spent having one of the most raucous parties that Ed can remember in years.\n\u201cHere you are, darling.\u201d\nHe feels the cool, gentle nudge of a glass against his cheek and raises a hand to take it without opening his eyes. The most he\u2019ll do is sit up to sip it, because he doesn\u2019t feel like getting any more alcohol on him than he probably already has.\n\u201cThanks, mate.\u201d\nEd cracks an eye open to watch Stede settle into his armchair with a long, contented sigh. The fire crackles merrily in the hearth, gilding Stede\u2019s profile and combing streaks of light through his golden curls. He\u2019s dressed down from the earlier party, in a rich blue banyan and the first few buttons of his collar undone. It\u2019s far from the first time Ed\u2019s caught breathless by how exquisite the man is\u2014softened curves and gentle lines where all Ed\u2019s ever known is sharp cuts and jutting edges. He\u2019s got that darling little crease in his forehead, the one he gets when he\u2019s pondering something. Ed has the absurd urge to squish his eyebrows together with his thumbs just to see it deepen. Sometimes he pictures what Stede will look like five, ten, twenty years from now and he can see it so clearly; the man will age like a fine wine, and fuck if Ed can\u2019t wait to savor it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that look in your eye,\u201d Ed sing songs, sipping the liquor\u2014he\u2019s surprised with a deep aroma of ripe fruits and spices and the heady tang of tannins. So not liquor, then. \u201cMmm. Nice wine, by the way.\u00a0\nCaaabernet\n\u2026?\u201d Stede\u2019s been trying to educate his palate whenever they could snag a good bottle, but he\u2019s still not totally sure what to call wine other than \u2018\ngrapey\u2019\n\u00a0half the time. He\u2019s able to tell a good one from a shit one now at least.\nNot like he won\u2019t still drink them both, but whatever.\nStede turns his attention away from the fire, eyebrow quirking. \u201cWhat look? And excellent work with your taste buds there, dearest. Do you like it? I\u2019ve been saving it for a special occasion. Top up?\u201d\nEd sits up as much as he\u2019s loathed to start the process of shucking off his shirt. He loves the material, something soft and breathable, but he\u2019s craving the satiny fineness of his robe. He gets an arm through it before offering his glass to Stede to refill.\n\u201c\nMhmm\n, please do. And the look of someone with an idea.\u201d He says coyly. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got going on in that big, beautiful, lunatic brain of yours?\u201d\nStede smiles, apples of his cheeks blooming a very bitable shade of pink. \u201cNothing, really. It\u2019s kind of silly, actually.\u201d Ed doesn\u2019t miss the way his eyes trail the expansive map of tattoos across his bare chest. He grins.\n\u201cWell, I think that should really be for me to decide, shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Ed says, placing his glass on the table as he saunters his way around it towards the chair. He leans over Stede like a shroud, hands on each arm rest and the robe closing them in like a curtain. Stede to his credit doesn\u2019t back down from the obvious flirt, bold with wine and what now Ed can joyously name as love. \u201cI mean, seeing as how I\u2019m pretty fuckin\u2019 sure I\u2019m gonna be playing a part in whatever you\u2019ve got cooking up there.\u201d\nHe taps Stede\u2019s temple gently and Stede can\u2019t keep a straight face. He\u2019s biting his lip to keep down the size of his smile, and oh, there\u2019s that pretty blush again. He looks like an overexcited kettle ready to boil right over, and honestly despite trying for flirty, Ed loves this look on him just as much as his bedroom eyes. He loves all Stede\u2019s expressions if he\u2019s honest though, so he\u2019s kind of a shit judge in that regard.\n\u201cWell if you really insist,\u201d Stede finally says in a rush, grabbing at his hands to pull him towards one of the bookshelves. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been working on a little something. Been thinking about that offer you\u2019d made a while back. About the, ah, the tattoo.\u201d\nStede kneels to look through the volumes on the bottom shelf and motions over his shoulder for Ed to sit as well. Ed watches with bemusement, swimming now into the realm of a pleasant buzz where he can\u2019t even feel his shitty knee complain about sitting crisscross on the floor. When Stede swirls around it\u2019s with a large journal similar to one of Lucius\u2019 and he places it gingerly between them. Ed looks down at the book and then back up at Stede\u2019s face, waiting for him to continue.\nStede takes a few deep, almost giddy breaths before flipping open the book. He skims a few pages before stopping abruptly.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the strongest artist,\u201d Stede says, holding his hand over the page. \u201cI had a lot of help from Lucius, and Frenchie also gave me some good ideas, and Buttons was invaluable help as well with the technical design of it\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019s rambling now. It\u2019s really,\u00a0\nreally\n\u00a0fucking cute.\nEd leans over the book to kiss him. Stede instantly shuts up, which was both the intended effect and an excellent distraction for him to sneak a peek down out of the corner of his eye at\u2014\n\u201cIs that a fucking bird?\u201d\nStede blinks, dazed from the kiss and\u00a0\nfuck\n\u00a0how is he so cute? He looks down at where his hand had strayed from covering a truly horrific depiction of what Ed can only guess is a seagull.\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d Stede laughs. \u201cFrenchie wanted to practice his portrait skills while we were brainstorming and made this lovely sketch of Olivia. I think he got her beak just right, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Ed says, silently relieved that whatever is on that page won\u2019t be on his other half\u2019s\u2026wherever. \u201cDefinitely. Even got the little sparkle of mischief in her eye.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201d\n\u201cGetting a bit distracted here, love.\u201d\nStede straightens up. \u201cAh, yes. Well. I guess I should probably just show you, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not sitting here on the floor half dressed and whole drunk for you to\u00a0\nnot\u00a0\nshow me, am I?\u201d\n\u201cQuite right.\u201d Stede takes another deep breath, closes his eyes, and flips the page.\nTo be honest, Ed wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d been expecting. Over the past few weeks since Stede had started to seriously consider getting one, he\u2019s floated quite a few ideas for his first tattoo around: an orange, a star, an anchor, a lighthouse (Ed had kissed that suggestion right out of his mouth), but never once had he mentioned this.\n\u201cA compass rose?\u201d Ed asks him. \u201cWhat made you think of this?\u201d\nNot unusual for a sailor, but it still takes Ed by surprise. It\u2019s a pretty design, a simple curved star in the cardinal directions with notches around it and a cut of arrows through it. What catches Ed\u2019s eye about it is that none of the directions are delineated except for East\u2014marked with a simple\u00a0\nx\n.\n\u201cI hate to break it to you, mate, but usually compasses point North.\u201d\nStede is looking at him now, really looking at him, and Ed suddenly feels thrown back years to that night on the deck, bathed in moonlight and clutching a tatty old piece of red silk. His heart skips, and for some reason his breath hitches at the sight of the tiny, earnest smile on Stede\u2019s face.\n\u201cWhen I was thinking of what I wanted, all I kept thinking was how permanent it was. How it should tell a story, of sorts. Tell something about me. And, well, I may not be much of a gifted navigator but I wanted something to show the one thing I do know for certain.\u201d Stede leans towards him and takes his hand in his, squeezing gently. He looks up into Ed\u2019s eyes, and\u00a0\nfuck\n, he thinks,\u00a0\nwhy do I feel like I\u2019m about to cry?\u00a0\n\u201cEdward Teach, no matter where I go in this world, no matter what happens, my compass points me to you.\u201d\nTears burn hot and furious in Ed\u2019s eyes, sudden as a riptide and just as hopeless to quell. He stares at Stede, disbelieving and so, so in love.\nStede suddenly looks bashful beneath Ed\u2019s wonderous adoration, and shyly turns back to the page to point out more details. \u201cI know that \u2018\nEast\u2019\n\u00a0is usually denoted by an \u2018\nE\u2019\n\u00a0on the map, but when I saw you sign the accord, you\u2019d used an \u2018\nx\u2019,\u00a0\nso I thought it would be a little secret of sorts. Kind of like a double meaning. Both for \u2018\neast\u2019\n\u00a0and for\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEdward,\u201d Ed chokes out.\nStede smiles gently, wiping Ed\u2019s wet cheek with his thumb. \u201cExactly right.\u201d\nEd just stares, motionless as Stede wipes away the tears from his eyes. His lips tremble as if fighting to speak, but what can he possibly say? How can he possibly even try to unravel the tangle of emotions that knot in his throat, to express the swell of love so strong that it threatens to crack open and spill from his very bones?\n\u201cSo,\u201d Stede asks, and even in his dazed state Ed can catch the self-conscious note of anxiety in his voice. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nThat snaps him out of it.\nEd surges across the space between them, grabbing Stede\u2019s face in his hands and swallowing the yelp of surprise as he knocks them both to the floor. He kisses Stede like it\u2019s the last time he\u2019ll ever do it, like he wants to cling to Stede\u2019s skin like the fine salt of the sea and never let go again. Stede gives just as good as he gets, the beautiful bastard, tracing the seam of Ed\u2019s lips with his tongue and making the most beautiful sounds Ed\u2019s ever heard in his life. He tastes like orange cake and cabernet, and if Ed doesn\u2019t just want to devour him whole.\n\u201cWhat do I think?\u201d Ed asks incredulously once they finally part for breath. \u201cI think that\u2019s the most romantic shit I\u2019ve ever heard in my life, Stede Bonnet, and that I love you, and that I want one too.\u201d\nStede looks so beautiful in the firelight, hair tousled and kissed breathless. \u201cYou do?\u201d He asks. Ed laughs and kisses him again because he simply can\u2019t stand not to.\n\u201cYes. Only mine will be\u00a0\n\u2018S\u2019\n\u00a0for Stede. Right here, over my heart.\u201d\nStede looks up at him, and if Ed\u2019s ever had a doubt he was loved, he\u2019ll never doubt again. It radiates from Stede, glowing like stars in his eyes and warms him down to his bones. He places his hand over Stede\u2019s heart, beating strong and steady as a drum. He likes to think his matches.\n\u201cGreat minds think alike, I guess.\u201d Stede says, placing his hand over Ed\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s just where I was thinking I\u2019d put mine.\u201d\n(\nx\n)"}, {"blog_name": "ninazenikistheloveofmylife", "id": 683287604609892352, "date": "2022-05-04 03:10:39 GMT", "timestamp": 1651633839, "tags": ["in honor of a podcast episode with taika and rhys talking about ofmd", "ofmd", "they dont know what queerness is", "like", "you stupid", "film bros", "fuck you", "well only five episodes had come out by that time but like", "what do you think", "you wear fine things well", "means?"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZYcGUTbxXdJ8Cq00", "note_count": 6, "body": "im so sick of film bros. like. those two dudes you saw on screen staring at each other with heart eyes? don\u2019t describe their relationship as a \u201cweird fascination\u201d. thEY\u2019RE IN LOVE YOU ASSHOLE-"}, {"blog_name": "cherry-blossom-nats", "id": 683038071163371520, "date": "2022-05-01 09:04:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1651395865, "tags": ["izzy hands", "edward teach", "ofmd", "ofmd meta"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZEHy5ebweu6-mi00", "note_count": 418, "body": "Kinda feeling feral over the facts that, until The Art of the Fuckery, a) Izzy is the only person on earth who knows Ed doesn't kill people, and, not only that, but b) he's \nexceptionally nonjudgmental\n about it even though he probably doesn't understand why it's a problem. If anything, he's fully on board with protecting this part of Ed privately while making a big show publicly of how tough \"Blackbeard\" is. His offer to take out Stede comes off like a twisted love letter; he knows it's difficult for Ed, so even though he's telling Ed to kill him in front of Ivan & Fang, he makes sure when they're alone that Ed knows that he's willing to do the job on his behalf.\nThat fact, combined with his stated love of Ed's brilliance as a sailor (as opposed to his love of the brutality) makes all of his actions so much more interesting. It's why I don't think he's in love with the Blackbeard persona. The Blackbeard persona is something they've crafted together to keep Ed, and by extension Izzy, safe in an extremely brutal world. He absolutely knows Ed struggles with killing people, and he even seems to get that Ed loves Stede (possibly before Ed knows that?). But in his mind, that's done something to Ed's brain, and beyond just the jealousy, there's also this subtext that if other people knew Ed was sometimes this sweet, soft guy, he'd be killed.\nRemember that one of the last things Ed says to Izzy before they meet Stede (conscious, not passed out) is that he hasn't tried dying yet. There is literally no reason for Izzy to think Ed has left that state of mind. He isn't around for the stuff Stede sees or does with Ed. By the end of the series there's no way Izzy could have known Ed was doing a lot better.\nDoes that mean Izzy is doing the right things throughout the season? Christ no, the dude's a total dick and has no clue how to handle a boss in the middle of a depressive state (to say nothing of the fact that Ed is seeing Stede in settings where he gets to be clever and cunning, while Izzy is only getting to see him as a sort of silly rich boy telling stories to his crew). Not only that, he's also mentally cracking up himself at the end of the series, as the only character who has nobody else he can rely on or turn to. But I wouldn't say he is in love with \"Blackbeard\" vs Ed (I wouldn't say he necessarily knows Ed as well as he thinks, but I think he knows he's not Blackbeard). He is keenly aware of the difference, because Blackbeard is a suit of armor he's been keeping in decent repair in order to protect the brilliant sailor who he knows for a fact struggles to kill others and be as cruel as they both think Blackbeard needs to be. And while jealousy plays a big role in things for him, so does the fact that the persona of Blackbeard is a safety net for him and, in his mind, Ed.\nWhen he says he serves Blackbeard, not Ed, I think it's literally because he \ncan't\n understand that Ed is healing. To his mind, Ed never left the place where he'd wanted to die, Stede's crew isn't good enough to keep them alive, and he's trying tough \"love\" (? in the most dickish way possible) because building a pillow fort and having Lucius transcribe sad song lyrics will only last them so long. He's telling Ed to put this armor back on, because the alternative is that they're both going to die, not realizing that Ed had better armor and that he was already wearing it."}, {"blog_name": "eph-em-era", "id": 683103365577818113, "date": "2022-05-02 02:22:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1651458135, "tags": ["wellington", "nz", "ofmd", "our flag means death", "fic", "mine"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z8E1wxbwtkHA8y01", "note_count": 2, "body": "\n        my only love, sprung from my only hate - Skyuni123 - Our Flag Means Death (TV) [Archive of Our Own]\n    \nStede's one of the theatre professors at certain Wellington university.

I was a little worried that I\u2019d be the only one who actually has any interest in that sort of thing, but I guess I\u2019m very wrong lol\nAnyway, so here\u2019s a basic outline of what I\u2019ve got so far. If anyone wants to run with this and write their own fanfics or something, go ahead, just tag me so that I can read the hell out of it\n Blackbeard as Dracula because if you really think about it, their characters are EXTREMELY similar. In some of the more humanizing moments, Dracula laments that even if he knows how to speak English, that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019d actually fit in London, and that he\u2019d still stick out like a sore thumb. Pretty much exactly like Blackbeard\u2019s desire to fit in with the nobles in episode 5. Dracula isn\u2019t even a name, it\u2019s an epithet, and so you bet your ass I\u2019m gonna run with the parallels to the Blackbeard title\n Stede as Jonathan because they\u2019re both chronic dumbasses who have no idea what they\u2019re doing and completely disregard the red flags that everyone around them have been begging them to look at. Also because it is my firm belief that Jonathan and Dracula should have kissed. \n Mary as Mina. I love Mina Harker and don\u2019t want to just dismiss her as \u201cthe female love interest\u201d, and I think that Jonathan and Mina have a very sweet relationship, but in a theoretical Dracula AU fit, Mary makes the most sense as \u201cwoman who doesn\u2019t hear from her fianc\u00e9 for months before he finally gets found in a hospital in Budapest with PTSD\u201d. If I do end up writing a full fan fiction, I\u2019ll try to make sure that she isn\u2019t just an obstacle to Blackstede and that she gets to have the cool moments that Mina has in the book\n Lucius as Lucy because they\u2019re both polyamorous and they both get killed/almost killed by Dracula/Blackbeard. Also, someone on discord pointed out that their names are basically the same already\nJim as Van Helsing because the prospect of Jim as a vampire hunter who acts first and then explains nothing until the very last minute is perfect to me. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure Van Helsing\u2019s wife was killed by vampires, and that could easily translate into Jim having their family killed by vampires as a motivation.\n Oluwande as John Seward. This is something I still need to work on a bit since a large part of Seward\u2019s character is that he\u2019s in love with Lucy, but besides that, Seward is one of the few characters who actually has brain cells, and he\u2019s also paired up with Van Helsing for most of the novel and since Jim is already filling that role, it makes sense to have Olu as their sidekick. \n Black Pete as Arthur Holmwood just because he\u2019s dating Lucius in the show and Arthur is boring enough that it\u2019s very easy to copy and paste Black Pete in his place. \n Dracula\u2019s wives are Izzy, Ivan, and Fang, just because that\u2019s Blackbeard\u2019s crew. The wives aren\u2019t really developed in the book so it\u2019s very easy to just throw them in. I am also incredibly amused by the prospect of Izzy being Blackbeard\u2019s malewife and getting scolded for almost eating Stede\n Buttons is Mr. Swales and I will not be taking any questions at this time. I\u2019m correct.\nThat\u2019s everything I have so far. I\u2019m still trying to figure out who to cast as Quincey Morris, the third of Lucy\u2019s suitors and resident cowboy. I\u2019m tempted to throw in Calico Jack purely because of the cowboy vibes he gives off, but it doesn\u2019t make much sense besides that. \nI do have an idea of what the story would look like, and I\u2019m VERY excited because it\u2019s surprisingly easy to tweak the story of Dracula to fit OFMD, but I don\u2019t want to throw all of my ideas out here since I\u2019m genuinely interested in seeing other people\u2019s ideas of what this AU might look like"}, {"blog_name": "bigassbowlingballhead", "id": 683013668398628864, "date": "2022-05-01 02:36:33 GMT", "timestamp": 1651372593, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "stede bonnet", "crown royal"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZATXzRbwZL09em00", "note_count": 1, "body": "One maybe small detail in our flag means death that I love is Stede\u2019s nice shovel that\u2019s kept in the glass case is covered by a crown royal whiskey bag"}, {"blog_name": "tired-lesbian-cryptid", "id": 683152856632705024, "date": "2022-05-02 15:28:53 GMT", "timestamp": 1651505333, "tags": ["ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZW83zRbx2_TIui00", "note_count": 5, "body": "Ofmd has become my library of verbal stims "}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683479577364938752, "date": "2022-05-06 06:01:58 GMT", "timestamp": 1651816918, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbyDGti4a00", "note_count": 1, "body": "Self-Aggrandize Fantasize Therapize\nby \nCloudsPassMeBy\nLucius and Izzy meet in a furry porn server\nIzzy texts like a soft femboy, Lucius is an artist.

Shut up shut up shut UP.\nBlack sails was a sad gritty prestige drama about being gay. That's what the cis-hets want gay media to be. Sad and gritty and about being gay. Also the majority of the people depicted are straight. Like....ya know.....all media ever.  \nOFMD literally has one straight for diversities sake and she really seems to be having a lot of fun breaking down gender roles just saying. They literally do not allow a single heterosexual kiss. There is no drama about how hard it is to be gay. Period typical racism and homophobia isn't shown in all it's graphic glory for the straights to pity and fear, it is DEFANGED and made sad and weak by comedy. Polyamory and casual non monogamy is depicted as perfectly chill and non judged. It's a whole fucking comedy that never mocks a single marginalized group, be it race or gender or color or body. Fat, weird looking, gender-squiggly, brown and black queer people have a nice time and fall in love and have zero angst about the fact that they're fucking queer. \nFor the first time in our queer little lives the whole SHOW was for us. About us. Relevant to us and alienating to the cis-hets. Not neatly packaged into a sad little exploitative struggle story for the hets to ooh and ahh at. The fucking conclusion of the whole fucking show was \"It's better to be out living a life with your weird queer friends and happy than stuck trying to settle down, no matter what the cost.\" Jesus, in a world where an amazing queer ending is where they pair up monogamously and settle down in a way that's palatable to cis-hets (abc family I am looking at you and your strangely straight married queers with kids), can you even conceive how freeing it is to have a fully cannonized world full of our people and none of theirs in a genre that the straights don't usually let us have content in? \nThis is an all-in-one-blow level of revolutionary that we usually don't get to see. We usually celebrate a drip of progress at a time. (And we should. Creators had to fight for that drip of progress and they deserve credit. OFMD got lucky.) I appreciate what came before but this.\nThis is unlike anything we've ever seen. \nAnd we will celebrate it in the way it deserves. No more picking for narratives that mean something to us from the scraps the cishets throw us. \nIt's THE Gay Pirate Show.

Here are all of the ones I noticed: \nEpisode 4 (Discomfort in a Married State) \n- The first time Ed lets his guard down in front of Stede the terrifying theme he and Izzy share established earlier in the show fades into a soft, orchestral arrangement of Gnossiennes: No.5-- the scene where Stede asks \"Do you fancy a fine fabric?\" \n- This same arrangement is heard when Stede and Ed are in the crow's nest the morning after pretending to be a lighthouse-- the music picks up a lot when Ed tries the Marmalade :') \nEpisode 5 (The Best Revenge is Dressing Well) \n- You can hear it in its piano form during the \"You wear fine things well\" scene (as if we needed more reason to cry during that scene). Similar to the way the music picks up with the marmalade, it picks up when Ed takes a step towards Stede\nEpisode 6 (The Art of F*ckery) \n- it is VERY SUBTLE, you can't quite hear it under their voices without headphones (at least I couldn't), but the scene where Ed is in the bathtub and Stede are talking about just forgetting the fact Ed had a murder plot against him you can hear it so so softly. \nEpisode 9 (Act of Grace) \n- THE KISS SCENE, FUCK.

Waves crash loud and seagulls sing strong but the voices around him muffle. The blindfold across his eyes kisses his skin like silk, all smooth and soft. He can\u2019t quite feel his legs though, gone numb from fear or anticipation as he rocks in time with his ship.\nHe is going to die.\nThere\u2019s a sound like a body hitting the deck, loud over the din of voices. He flinches, wonders if he will sound the same.\nThe sun is warm on his face and the salty sting of air is sort of heaving into his lungs and blood is pumping loud and hot through his veins. His body has never felt more alive, stubbornly so. \nHe doesn\u2019t want to die. He\u2019s a lighthouse, isn\u2019t he? Meant to stand tall and weather all storms.\nPanic floods him swift as the tide. He\u2019s aware that he\u2019s muttering, crying, not quite the face of bravery, not as tall and stalwart as the structure he\u2019s meant to emulate. It\u2019s just \u2014 he rather likes being alive. Likes drinking tea in the morning, likes stories before bed, likes fine fabric and books and scented soaps. He likes being a pirate and he likes his crew and he likes his co-captain.\nHe likes all those things even though he doesn\u2019t deserve them. Not with who he abandoned to get there, those he left behind to get dashed on the rocks. He thinks of his family like a final confession. This death a penance served in their name.\nHe hopes it won\u2019t hurt too much, hopes salvation lies in wait. Perhaps it will be quick. A sudden burst of sunlight.\nSomeone is shouting and he can\u2019t make out the words but he knows the voice. He whispers the name like prayer, reverent and thankful.\nThere\u2019s shouting all around now, his senses still feel off-kilter. Can\u2019t make out the words, can\u2019t feel his feet, can\u2019t stop crying.\nA body steps in front of him, between him and his end. He still can\u2019t see but he doesn\u2019t need to, knows him blind. His savior is close; he can feel the heat radiating from him, smell the tang of sweat and sea salt and the stench of leather.\nThe shouting picks up again. Shouting at him, ordering him to speak up, repeat the phrase. The words tangle on his tongue, clumsy as he spits them out. Grace. In his final moments he asks for grace.\nHands on his cheeks, leather against his skin, fingers slip under that soft fabric, and then light. Bright. Brilliant. Blinding.\nAs he blinks the sun out of his gaze the world comes into focus in a kaleidoscope of color. Most bright is Ed, staring at him. He is the single most astounding thing Stede has ever seen. A smile pulls on his cheeks.\nThere is no smile on Ed\u2019s face. Ed is looking at him in awe and relief and wonder. Some fear slithers back into his heart at the expression. Ed must have really thought he was going to die, thought his light would be snuffed.\nThe blindfold is pushed to his hairline now. Ed\u2019s hands stop like he\u2019s frozen.\nHe can hear other voices but they don\u2019t seem important. Not the man ordering his execution or the officers yelling back or the guns still aimed and ready to fire. The only thing that matters is stood right before him looking at him in a way no one has before. In a way he\u2019s never looked at anyone either. There\u2019s a word for this he knows, this feeling swelling up inside him so fast he might suffocate, like sunlight has struck his soul. He never knew it felt like this. He gazes upon Ed bearing witness to something divine.\nWhen Ed kisses him, it feels inevitable and novel and sacred all at once. There is no worry or fear or second-guessing, only a sensation of finally.\nIt is not anything like the chaste kisses he once exchanged with his wife. This is all-consuming, full of life. He feels it down to his toes, his bones, his soul. Feels as though a piece inside has shifted, unlocked, and for the first time understands what the poets say when they speak of love. It is the lighthouse and the light. The keeper who ignites the flame and the ship who avoids that light at all costs. It is the rocks waiting to dash the ship should it ever feel temptation and the sailor whose final thought as the sea takes them is wondering if it is worth it.\nIt is.\nEd\u2019s hands cradle him. One settles against the base of his skull, fingers in his hair, the other against the small of his back. An embrace. His mouth is warm and moves sure against his own. Turning one kiss into two into four until Stede is chasing him when he pulls away, molding their lips together because he needs just one more. His own hands are bound behind his back. He aches to touch and tangle and feel.\nIt is one second that lasts a lifetime. It is an eternity coalesced into but one moment. It is a kiss and a confession and a promise and a vow.\nWhen Ed pulls back Stede has to blink against the sun again. He hadn\u2019t realized he closed his eyes. A wide smile paints itself across Ed\u2019s face, his eyes are practically alight. Stede wants to kiss him again. So he does.\nThe shouting around them is starting to make sense.

With men and their stockings. Which, as we know, are form fitting, and can therefore show off calves to their utmost advantage-- or lack thereof.\nSo some dudes at the time apparently felt the need to... supplement their calves. With falsies.\nCalf\n \nfalsies\n.\nSo it would, to me, be \nvery funny\n if Ed sort of, like, \nnotes\n early on that Stede has \nsurprisingly defined calves\n for somebody who's swanning around dressed (and presumably as well-exercised) as the most uppercrust of indolent dandies.\nAnd he doesn't say anything to Stede because, well-- listen, he's ransacked enough rich men's underwear drawers to know that falsies exist, and if Stede feels the need for \nenhancements\n then it's no skin off Ed's nose one way or the other. And anyway, they're spending most of their days in one another's company, so it'll become obvious sooner or later, right? \nRight. \nSo no need to ask Stede about it. No need to, say, seat himself just below Stede during the evening storytelling at an angle that might let him check for the telltale bump of knotted ties beneath his stockings. No need to wonder at all, really, at any time, about Stede's calves, and knees, and the expensive knitted silk rolled up and over them, tucked every single day just as tight as you please under the band of his damn-near painted-on satin breeches. \nThere's absolutely no call for it because, eventually, Stede will slip. He'll forget himself, just for a moment, and then Ed will know and that'll be that. Accidents happen all the time on shipboard, that's just the way of it. No need to rush things along at all.\nFor instance, maybe one day Stede'll step into something foul and feel the need to strip off his stocking. Could happen to anybody. Practically a daily occurrence. But Stede, he probably wouldn't want to wait around in the muck, he'd probably have to take it off immediately, right where he's standing, just unbutton the band at his knee and get his fingers under it so he can find the stocking's welt, feel it out all careful as can be so he doesn't catch against the delicate silk and snag it beyond repair-- but it'd be easy enough for Stede, what with all the practice he's had dressing and undressing on his own now, easy for him to hook his fingers into the stocking and ease it out, roll it down, finally flash his plumpers and show where they ended and he began and-- \nOr \nmaybe,\n Ed thinks with some feverishness, maybe like, maybe he'll ask Ed to stay after breakfast, to keep talking while Stede just changes for the day, and he'll keep the door to the closet open, not to tease but just to let their voices through, all normal, all fine, but god knows Stede loves his mirrors, and there's one that Ed is absolutely positive would-- if only Stede would stand just so and leave the door open just enough-- would in fact yield the reflection of Stede setting his clean, bare heel on one of the closet's little embroidered footstools, finally unclothed but for pale hair and pale skin and the dips and faint hollows where the bone would show shadowed in morning candlelight and half miraged in mirror view-- and then Ed would finally \nsee,\n he'd finally have fucking \nproof\n that Stede didn't have that cut of muscle curving firm and palm-sized at his calf, that it was all cotton pads and careful knots and a rich man's brand of fuckery to capture a strength he didn't have, didn't really need to be honest, Stede was strong enough, alive enough in these hellish waters that he didn't need to prove anything to anyone, alive or dead, and so if Stede would just \ntell\n him, just slip \none damned time\n so Ed could finally decide whether he wanted to burn the damn things or tie them on as sweetly as Stede needed or, or-- \nor--\n...Which is how, about a month into their voyage together, when Stede does, in fact, invite Ed to stay after breakfast, and to keep talking while he changes, and he asks Ed if he minds him leaving the door open a little but, heh, not to worry, he moved the mirror into the bed nook just that morning, so no need to fear any \"stark revelations,\" heh, d'ya get it Ed, like that time, and of course \"starkers,\" classic punnery--\n--only to hear the abrupt sounds of what seem to be, in order:\nStede's quite expensive dining table: flipped\nhis delightfully matched morning dishware: shattered\na non-zero number of his cleverly carpentered cabinet drawers: yanked from their moorings, dashed to the floor\nwhat he now suspects to be, embarrassingly enough, his \nunmentionables:\n tossed, thrown, riffled through, and probably wrinkling\nand one extremely irate pirate: thumping through it all while swearing very, very loudly that he intends to \"find the buggery fucking fucks so help me \nfucking\n \nChrist--\"\nAnd Stede decides that Ed needs a moment, so he'll just go ahead and close the door and get finished dressing on his own before he ventures out to see just how accurate his guesses were."}, {"blog_name": "bisexual-birdy", "id": 683547645341499393, "date": "2022-05-07 00:03:53 GMT", "timestamp": 1651881833, "tags": ["ofmd", "tw: caps"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZlWP_cbySlOxee01", "note_count": 1, "body": "STOP I LOVE BLACKBEARD"}, {"blog_name": "beforeiteverstarts", "id": 683584321392656384, "date": "2022-05-07 09:46:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1651916810, "tags": ["ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZU7Cnxbyb56Aei00", "note_count": 3, "body": "i wanted to apologize for that our flag means death spam but i will not cause i have absolutely nothing to apoloize for the show is perfect they are all perfect and consider me chokeholded even though it\u2019s illegal asshole"}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683770246182715392, "date": "2022-05-09 11:02:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1652094121, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbzFMg7iy00", "note_count": 0, "body": "Pretty Little Things\nby \nSlow_Burn_Sally\nStede needs help putting on his frilly shoes for an outing.

He just stares at Buttons, and it seems like he's just... confused. Which is understandable. But later in the episode, when Stede goes \"I didn't know this forest was haunted\" - at first Izzy is like \"lmao come on it's obviously one of your men\". But as Stede keeps questioning, it seems like there is a small sliver of a doubt in Izzy's eyes before he calls out to Ivan. I'd like to think Buttons managed to plant the thought of the island being haunted in his head, but again, might be he's just confused by these idiots.\nThen, in ep 6 we can see how the whole crew has gathered together to share and listen to some scary stories. Well, almost the whole crew: we have Ivan, Fang, and Izzy hanging out together away from others, seemingly too cool to participate. And from what I understand, they are standing pretty far away. Maybe far enough to be out of earshot? Yeah, I know. They are tough pirates who do not care about, let alone believe in, some made up spooky tales. So. It's okay even if they (Izzy) can't hear what the others are talking about. Yep.\nBut if these (admittedly flimsy) pieces of evidence really are hints towards Izzy's fear of ghosts and the like, the theories about Lucius surviving and living in the walls of the Revenge get even more interesting and potentially hilarious. I absolutely would love to see Izzy slowly losing his sanity as Lucius starts \"haunting\" the Revenge - maybe by accident at first. He is trying to stay in hiding, after all. However, when Lucius realizes all the possibilites, I'm pretty sure he'd engage in some serious Fuckery\u2122.

And Ed is the one that's like hey maybe don't announce that we all have a bunch of valuables and money on us and hey crew pls do be careful and do you remember what to do if u need us and can't find us, let's go over it quickly (because like. Ed falls so easily into party mode when he's aware he can let loose (or fkn Calico Jack comes around) with minimal damage even if 'minimal' is maybe not that minimal at all sometimes so I think once he's actually at the point again of feeling like he can just Be Ed around the crew he becomes the Mom Friend of the group lmaooo.) \nAnd there's almost always shenanigans. Like this would also be ideal time for date night for them but u know there's gonna be interruptions (to them and also probably to any other crew members that are together trying to use that time as date night. No one gets any peace \ud83d\ude05)\nThere's so much u could stuff into any episode ideas for this too. Like, just one: Mr. Buttons has gone around this port amassing a massive flock of seagulls that are obedient to his homemade leashes that are long enough the birds could damn near fly a half mile away and still be attached to him technically. He is refusing to believe the rest of the crew when they say Stede and Ed won't let him keep them all. Stede and Ed are pulled from a lovely little dinner in a disgusting tavern that a man was just stabbed in (but neither of them did the stabbing, so not their problem lol) and dragged by probably Oluwande and Jim (who were also on a nice picnic date in a clearing until they heard shouting and saw a flock of seagulls and just. Sigh deep in their souls because Some Shit is afoot.)\nAlso very important tho silly: a flock of seagulls song must be used in this ep. \nAnyway, this leads to Stede mumbling thru a refusal to take on an entire flock (but he isn't strong enough to say no completely, so Mr. Buttons does keep abt five of them as new friends) which leads to hey wait a goddamn minute why does Mr. Buttons get a pet and we all don't?! Which is valid so Stede can't be upset with them but he also I think realizes how far he put his foot in his mouth with this situation now and has to deal with it but would really rather the whole thing just go away lmao\nEspecially as Ed is zero help. Teasing that he basically did make it sound like they could all have a little buddy. Maybe not a seagull but some other sea bird, who knows. Maybe a pelican. \nThis leads to other suggestions and discussion that they finally decide Mr. Buttons can have his birds, but the rest will choose one crew pet to all look after. The initial suggestions:\n-a whale, and we could teach it to scout ahead and tell us where valuable ships are! This is shot down by Stede who reminds them that whales are used to ppl in ships harpooning them, so they probably wouldn't be keen on humans on a ship. Also, whales don't speak English nor do they as a crew speak Whale \n-a dog. Stede likes this one, as does Ed, however the key issue is no one has seen a dog at any port in awhile that didn't already have an owner so...fuck. \n-A giant squid. Shot down by Ed, who made the valid points that much like whales, squids don't have much reason to like humans, and also how would they 'keep' a squid? Like physically or emotionally? Doesn't feel possible to Ed. \nAnd so on and so forth until it's mostly playful bickering until\nAnd this is the bit where it's key to remember the show is historically accurate when it wants to be and other times not akbdkfngn\nIzzy rolls up holding a goldfish in a bowl. He won it, he explains, but he needs to get it in a much bigger home on the ship cuz that little bowl isn't nearly enough room. \nThere are so many questions, but only Stede and Ed are bold enough to ask any of them. Unfortunately, they are not the most important questions. Instead it's: what did you name him? And where are they giving away free fish and why? \nWhich is a long road to them eventually making a not historically accurate but who cares tank for the goldfish, and while he lives in Izzy's quarters they all end up helping to feed and visit the fish\nBut they're really in deep when they finish up the emergency fish pod device they cook up, in case they ever have to abandon ship in a hurry\nAfter all, Izzy Jr is a crew member now! They aren't going to leave any person (or fish) behind! \nThe metrics of actually shooting this and making it work re: set design would be a nightmare I think but also. Izzy practicing getting Izzy Jr into the emergency bowl pod thing because he doesn't want to be caught off guard if the worst should happen \ud83e\udd7a"}, {"blog_name": "tworidiculousmen", "id": 683020124557639680, "date": "2022-05-01 04:19:10 GMT", "timestamp": 1651378750, "tags": ["i actually cant comprehend that the creators and actors Know that they\u2019re doing a romance!", "they KNOW that they\u2019re in Love! they Talk about it!", "lmao stede voice: they talk about it!", "ofmd", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zq0b1gbwaoywiu00", "note_count": 10, "body": "i cant believe this show exists fnsbcmsb"}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683388977087217664, "date": "2022-05-05 06:01:55 GMT", "timestamp": 1651730515, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbxugTciu00", "note_count": 1, "body": "anything for his captain\nby \nbelowtheprecipice\nIt was all a mistake of Izzy's making.

He rejects tenderness and emotion! Now does he need it and would it break him, \nabsolutely\n, but he\u2019s not ready for that yet. So instead: enter Jim. Jim, who is \u2018normal secretive\u2019 (\nnot\n normal secretive), reserved, edgy, and very much closed off to most people. \nNow \nhere\u2019s\n someone that Izzy can actually respect! Sure, Izzy\u2019s not \nfriends\n with anyone, let alone a member of Bonnet\u2019s crew - that\u2019s absurd! - but at the very least, with some time, I truly think that Izzy would come to respect Jim. They\u2019re skilled, they\u2019re more than ready to kill people, and they don\u2019t worry about that mushy gushy \nfeelings\n bullshit. \nBut here\u2019s the difference between Izzy and Jim: while Izzy is pretty much completely closed off from everyone at this point, Jim isn\u2019t anymore! They have Oluwande! They\u2019re starting, bit by bit, to open up to this person - this \none\n person that they love and trust, who\u2019s been so patient with them, who has shown them that it\u2019s safe to open up with people. \nSo, while Jim and Izzy have both spent a long time living by the rule of \u2018trust nobody, let no one in\u2019, Jim has already begun their exploration into the world of expressing emotions and trusting people. So!!!! Jim already kind of knows how to start! And they wouldn\u2019t try to push Izzy immediately into any dramatic acts of trust or softness, because there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to allow that right off the bat. But Jim has been where Izzy is. They know it\u2019s scary to open up, that it\u2019s all too easy to just keep bottling up all your sticky, messy bullshit. But they also know that it\u2019s impossible to keep going like that forever.\nMaybe, after a (mostly) friendly sword fight or two, Izzy really starts to respect Jim. And Jim, to their own surprise, kind of starts to respect Izzy too. They see a little bit of something else, deep down, and it compels them. Maybe they even see a tiny bit of themself, even if Izzy is a very different (and twisted) man. They may not \ntrust\n each other, but Jim has the beginnings of an urge to start poking, and Izzy\u2019s ready to listen. He\u2019s not going to push them away - and Jim will make sure of that, never nudging him too hard. It\u2019s not a fucking excavation after all, it\u2019s not like Jim is interested in being his therapist. But maybe, \nmaybe\n, they can chip a teeny little bit of his bitter, angry crust away. \nJim knows not to go too deep - they don\u2019t even know \nhow\n to do that anyways. They sure as hell aren\u2019t interested in getting all goopy and soft. But they know what Olu taught them. They start with the little things. Little questions, little prodding. Leaving out some crumbs for Izzy to take, even if he doesn\u2019t want to. Even if the first few times they ask about his name, or his tattoos, he doesn\u2019t give them more than a grunt. But after a while, maybe, by the time Jim\u2019s almost forgotten they asked, they hear a muttered, \u201cIsrael. My real name is Israel.\u201d They take it without a word. Just a nod. They sit in a silence that is almost companionable. \nListen. Izzy \ncannot. handle. \ngrand, open acts of affection. Vulnerability disgusts him, terrifies him. Even if Lucius or Stede or the Conceptual Golden Retriever Boyfriend were to offer it, Izzy is \nnot\n ready. Not yet, not the Izzy we know. But!!! I think he could take little pieces, just starting small. Things that he can easily brush off, or ignore with another indifferent grunt. Like half of an apple cut by Jim\u2019s knife, silently offered and accepted. Or a hand extended to him when he falls on his ass after being - very fairly, very skillfully - beaten in a practice duel. It surprises him, but he takes it, and lets Jim pull him up. \nI think eventually, Jim could have a conversation with Izzy about opening up. Something along the lines of telling him that he doesn\u2019t need to open up to \neveryone - \njust someone. At the very least, he needs to start by letting one person in. And it doesn\u2019t have to be Jim - hell, lord knows they don\u2019t have time to dig into whatever crazy shit he\u2019s got going on under all that - but he\u2019s got to pick someone. Because it\u2019s worth it. Because eventually, everyone gets tired of you slamming the door on them, and they\u2019ll stop knocking. \nOf course, at some point when Jim reunites with the crew of the Revenge, everyone will get to talking again about how annoying Izzy is, and how they should just throw him overboard - for real this time. But Jim mumbles a little, \u201cOh, he\u2019s not so bad when you get to know him.\u201d Everyone looks at them like they\u2019re crazy, but it gets in their heads, gets them thinking. If Jim can get along with Izzy, then there must be something half-decent about him, right? \nRight?\nIf you asked Izzy the same question, he might not be able to answer. But\u2026 \nmaybe\n he\u2019s ready to try and be half-decent, at least. He\u2019ll die before admitting it. But it makes him consider. Maybe, next time someone comes knocking, he\u2019ll let them in. Just a little.

So less than 28 days ago Jim and Oluwande joined the crew. Jim writes their journal after the plant robbery so Jim and Oluwande are new members of the crew. We don't know how the crew was put together. Did Stede hire everyone at once? If that is true, the crew is really new and Stede has been pirating only like... a bit over a month. I can imagine it took him a while to get things sorted out but in general the whole pirating things is very fresh news in episode 1.\n- When Blackbeard and Stede meet and they have the whole mist/fog thing with fake lighthouse Blackbeard thinks it's September the 2nd but it's the 1st. So... Stede has been pirating over Caribbean for three months making himself known as the Gentleman Pirate. How did he survive alive?\nAnd even funnier is that Stede meets Izzy during same events when Jim writes their journal, somewhere around June the 4th to... maybe June the 10th? After that Blackbeard learn the existence of the Gentleman Pirate and spend almost three months trying to meet him???\n- Blackbeard says on episode 9 on the beach that the couple of weeks they have spent together have been his best weeks ever. Maybe it's 2 weeks but I think it's more like 4 weeks or even a bit longer. People tend to be vague about time.\n(During that time Stede got stapped twice and Blackbeard once, but let's not look too deep into that because in OFMD universe a stap wound is dangerous only if the plot says so.)\n- Stede's son Louis is has forgotten who Stede is. That hints Stede has been gone a while. Louis is maybe three years old. I know nothing about kids, how long it takes to forget something quite big like who is your father?\nSo... Stede has spent at least 4\u20135 months on the sea.

Context: I finished binging the show and promptly had a \nlot\n of thoughts about what the scene where Blackbeard tips Lucius overboard is doing thematically and narratively. Enjoy!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSo.\nThe bathtub scene, right.\nA few things to establish up front:\nOne, I did not fully appreciate the impact of Lucius going overboard in the moment bc \nI didn\u2019t realize the season ended on a bad time cliffhanger\n and I absolutely assumed he was gonna turn up alive again before the end. It shifts my thoughts a \nlot\n that he did not.\nTwo, I\u2019m still \npretty sure\n he\u2019ll turn up alive if/when we get s2 \u2014 whether he got back onboard and is living in the walls, or Calico Jack floated by in a rowboat and pulled him out of the water, or what. But as far as \nBlackbeard\n knows right now, he\u2019s dead. That was the intention. And because of the way the season ended, bc they \ndidn't \ntease his survival as certainty, we the audience are left to at least speculate what it means if he\u2019s really dead.\nThree, One Can Argue that if \u201ctechnically the fire killed them\u201d is Ed\u2019s excuse for how he didn\u2019t ACTUALLY KILL the people on the boat in that story, then he could look at Lucius\u2019s death as \u201ctechnically the water killed him.\" And I think it does matter, actually, that Ed tipped him overboard instead of putting a knife in his ribs! Or without putting a knife in his ribs \nfirst\n and \nthen\n tipping him over to get rid of the body. Put a pin in that, I\u2019ll get back to it. But even in the land of playing with technicalities to survive the crushing weight of your own guilt, there\u2019s something different between setting a fire and leaving people to their fate, and physically hurling a grown man into the ocean. They\u2019re gonna feel different.\nSo the bathtub scene, right.\nI kind of eyebrow raise at Ed\u2019s assertion that he\u2019s never killed ANYONE else \u2014 much like Bat \u201cI don\u2019t kill\u201d man tossing men off a wall, there are things this guy does that are \ngoing\n to be deadly even if he doesn\u2019t mean them to be. I mean you\u2019re living on pirate ships in the 18th century my guy, how many of those severed toes turned septic.\nBut let\u2019s take him at his word that he\u2019s never intentionally and personally delivered a proximately fatal injury since he murdered his father, bc I don\u2019t think he\u2019s supposed to be lying in that scene at all.\n(If anything, the fact that he\u2019s desperate to separate himself from a \nlot\n more deaths that he would most certainly bear legal and ethical responsibility for, just says a great deal about how badly he\u2019s been coping with death and violence ever since he first set foot on a pirate ship.)\nEd, then, by tipping Lucius overboard, is doing something that the popular vision of Blackbeard attributes to him without question, but that Ed himself has only ever done once in his life before: deliberately murdering a man with his own two hands. No crew. No Izzy. Just him.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to speculate that this was a test Ed set for himself: if he couldn\u2019t throw Lucius overboard, then he couldn\u2019t be the kraken. He couldn\u2019t be Blackbeard. If he hesitated, if he failed, then everything goes differently. He is in effect sinking himself \ndeeper\n into the identity of Blackbeard than before: if Blackbeard was originally a mask of performance and fuckery that he put on for his reputation, now he is trying to \nbehave\n like Blackbeard would, crossing lines he\u2019s kept between \"Blackbeard\" and \"Ed\" for years. Even with no one around to witness.\nTo return to the pin: is there still plausible deniability (to himself) in leaving Lucius to drown? Yeah, some. Imo, it\u2019s a marker of the fact that he knows his limits: he probably \nwouldn't\n have managed a knife into Lucius\u2019s heart. He would have hesitated, \nand he didn't want to hesitate\n. So he picked the middle ground: something certain to be fatal, and enacted by his own two hands, but still with a sliver of distance from stabbing or strangling or shooting. It\u2019ll be interesting (IF WE GET ANOTHER SEASON) to see what he does as this continues, bc I could see him gearing up into more and more violence and direct murder. Equivalently, though, you could definitely write him continuing to break down in such a way that he never does it again.\nEither way, though: let\u2019s talk about WHY LUCIUS\n(the thing I really wanted to get to with this long ramble lol)\nThere are a few obvious answers from a diegetic character perspective:\nLucius, of everyone on the crew, is most similar to Stede: he\u2019s literate, intelligent, clearly has some cultural education. He has soft hands; he does not do physical labor, he doesn\u2019t fight: he scribes.\nLucius is the one who saw their relationship happening most clearly, arguably before either Stede or Ed saw it themselves. He encouraged and bullied Ed into making himself vulnerable and available to Stede, he told Ed off for leaving, HE TOLD ED STEDE CARED FOR HIM\nHe\u2019s the most emotionally perceptive and insightful member of the crew, which arguably makes him the most dangerous as Ed executes his coup into Blackbeard. It was important to eliminate him before he could realize something was up and warn the others.\nHe doesn\u2019t fight, at least not much and not well, which also makes him an easy mark. He trusts Ed, his guard will be down, and he doesn\u2019t have the reflexes for an unexpected attack. If Ed is testing himself, he can be sure it will be done quick, rather than turn into a scuffle and ruin everything.\nSo from both a practical perspective and a \u201cFUCK you for your shitty relationship advice and for reminding me of his existence\u201d standpoint, \nthere's a lot of reasons\n Blackbeard wants Lucius gone first.\nBut this show has fuckin \nlayers\n and it\u2019s doing things on a thematic level here \ntoo\n. And it 1000% goes back to the \u201cwe don\u2019t own each other here\u201d episode that I yelled about in the original thread.*\nBecause Lucius \nembodies\n \u201cwe don\u2019t own each other here\u201d. He\u2019s both the mouthpiece and the demonstration of that philosophy. He is openly, swaggeringly confident, joyous, unafraid of himself, his own desires, his strengths, and unashamed of his weaknesses. Telling Izzy he can\u2019t scrape the barnacles is funny, and silly (and there\u2019s a definite sympathetic-to-Izzy angle here of \u201coh my god I know it\u2019s not fun \nbut you do in fact need to take care of the boat which you live on\n\") but it\u2019s also a demonstration of the fact that Lucius gets, in general, to be treated with respect for his own strengths, without demands that he participate in work that risks jeopardizing those strengths (hurting his hands), even when his strengths don\u2019t line up with a stereotypical pirate.\nIn other words: Lucius is all the good things about Stede\u2019s crew fully realized.\nHe\u2019s the thing Stede and Ed \ncould become\n, if they are given a chance. Not his exact personality, but his confidence and ease at being fully himself, in a way that brings him joy. No one owns Lucius Spriggs. No one dictates how he lives his life. It\u2019s exactly the opposite of Izzy, who wants nothing more than he wants to \nbe\n owned, to be made in someone else\u2019s image, who clings to the image that other people have of him and of Blackbeard like it\u2019s his only lifeboat. Which is why of course Izzy is the villain and why Izzy and Lucius are foiled so much. (And god bless the writers for making queerness and sexuality an inseparable part of this, that for all these characters the ability to be oneself is deeply tied to love and sex and freedom of choice about those things.)\nSo to circle all the way back around: Ed doesn\u2019t just throw Lucius overboard for giving him an undeserved shovel talk, he throws Lucius overboard because he is both literally and figuratively throwing away the future Stede\u2019s crew represents. He has to get rid of Lucius, because Lucius is the vision of all the things Ed is deciding that he cannot be.\nSo it\u2019s a test, for himself: can he be the kraken, can he do it again, can he kill.\nAnd yes, \nphysically\n Lucius is an easy mark, and a practical one, and also Ed is pissed at him. But it\u2019s another kind of test too: not just can he kill, but can he kill \nthat future specifically\n. It\u2019s a decision Ed makes, in that moment, not just to be the kraken, not just to kill, but to remove Lucius and thereby remove everything he represents.\nOk thank you for coming to my very rambly TEDTalk, I have so many thoughts and this series is so good and smartly written I could seriously talk about it for days.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*I realized after posting that most of this was actually \nnot\n in my original liveblog but rather on the side account bc that's where I put the majority of my Izzy Hands thoughts for everyone's safety, but this is what I said about that scene:\nHello hi yes I\u2019m losing my mind over Lucius, the tagalong scribe guy for the first few episodes, suddenly being The One In Control when it\u2019s Izzy left to handle the boat by himself and how explicitly it\u2019s about sexuality and seduction and Izzy\u2019s repression. The power dynamics going on here are \nfascinating\n.\nI am thinking \nso\n hard about \"we don't know each other here\". Just, the number of things built into that\nthat Izzy tries emotionally manipulative blackmail on Lucius in the first place, rather than just idk threatening to whip him or something\nthat he *expects the blackmail to work*, bc he ASSUMES Lucius is doing this behind Pete\u2019s back\nthat Lucius on Stede\u2019s crew is not even slightly ashamed or discomfited or hiding anything about who\u2019s getting naked with and around him\nthat Lucius doesn\u2019t just identify the threat but *lasers in on* the place and assumptions Izzy is making it from\nthat the comeback is not \u201ceveryone knows, who cares\u201d but instead \u201cyou don\u2019t understand ANYBODY ON THIS BOAT\u201d, and also \u201cyou don\u2019t get to have that kind of power over me or anyone, not here\u201d\nthat it\u2019s ALSO \u201cno one will own you either\u201d which is its own kind of threat to izzy\nHe doesn\u2019t get to be owned which means he is crushingly, excruciatingly alone bc no one WANTS him people only USE him\nAnd Izzy has made himself scary enough and powerful enough that the only person who GETS to use him is Blackbeard, but oh my terrible grimy pirate man, what in your past made you Like This bc it must be something"}, {"blog_name": "coat-and-hat", "id": 683073949536518144, "date": "2022-05-01 18:34:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1651430081, "tags": ["this is about 13rw btw", "ofmd", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z5Nu1fbwn2DLSe00", "note_count": 12, "body": "jokes aside the toe scene in ofmd does show that you can write an intentionally upsetting/graphic/shocking scene without sending the audience into an uproar"}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683253045377859584, "date": "2022-05-03 18:01:20 GMT", "timestamp": 1651600880, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbxPmPLSu00", "note_count": 0, "body": "The Rumor\nby \nPhantomLights\nLucius heard a rumor about Izzy, and the things he and Blackbeard would get up to behind closed doors...

A metric ton of ship imagery,\u00a0songs about pining and thinking you don\u2019t deserve love because you\u2019re a monster, TWO William Finn songs about gay men sailing, and of course a dark spiral into pirate ANGST.\nResisting the urge to explain why I chose every song, but here\u2019s a few random thoughts:\nthere is a song called Edward is Dedward and it\u2019s so perfect I want to cry.\nThis playlist is 95% Stede/Ed, with a few bonus tracks for Olu/Jim (Mariner\u2019s Revenge Song is pure Jim vibes) and of course, \u2018No Children\u2019 for our favorite toxic relationship, Izzy and Blackbeard.\nAnyway, enjoy and know that I\u2019m already working on a second playlist."}, {"blog_name": "one-cosmic-latte-please", "id": 683725730173108224, "date": "2022-05-08 23:14:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1652051668, "tags": ["ofmd", "ofmd s1e4", "liveblog"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z43t4Sbz5EtMmq00", "note_count": 1, "body": "look now I\u2019m just imagining Quark in Izzy\u2019s outfit thanks to \nthat recent fanart\n. so I hate Izzy a little less now.

after all, they did flee the privateer academy, which breaks the contract they signed. therefore, season 2 ends with Ed and Stede being forced apart by a powerful enemy, either one captured by England and one free but determined to save the other (or perhaps, if David is feeling particularly evil, one believing the other is dead; after season 1\u2019s ending, my money would be on Stede believing Ed is dead at the end of s2), or both captured and forcibly separated. this will lead to season 3, wherein Stede and Ed fight to get back to each other and eventually have to take down the Big Bad together, which will allow them to finally be free to exist as a couple, though whether or not that\u2019s under their real names or even as pirates remains to be seen.

Ed threw himself fully into being an aristocrat Stede\u2019s way, but abandoned it to do it HIS way (telling bloody stories, general rowdiness) despite Stede warning the aristocrats would use his uniqueness against him. Then instead of ignoring their inevitable passive aggression, Ed yells as them and runs, resorting to violence instead of the tactics Stede taught him. He\u2019s sensitive to failure, like any perfectionist. \nGranted, Ed tried to cope healthfully about Stede\u2019s abandonment, but gave that up when push came to shove. Izzy was a factor, but Ed ultimately made the decision to return to his comfort zone (not that the Kracken is fun for him, but it\u2019s an assured path of success). \nThe burnout was inevitable\u2014part of why Ed gets bored is the lack of challenge. Unlike schooling where you\u2019re moved up a level if it\u2019s too easy, as soon as pirating gets too difficult, it ends in death. \nSeeing Stede bringing that novelty back to pirating was enough to get Ed to continue, implying pirating itself wasn\u2019t the issue, but his company. But if pirating wasn\u2019t what bored him, the domesticity found in serving the king would\u2019ve bored him too\u2014Ed\u2019s instant abandonment of that to run to China proves that. Part of Ed enjoys folding socks, but also maiming people. He can\u2019t be the violent Kracken AND peaceful Ed, because too much of either extreme will leave him bored. The same things that bored him about pirating (\u201cthere\u2019s no stakes, there\u2019s no drama, there\u2019s no fuckin LIFE!\u201d) not only drove Stede to abandon that life, but would do so for Ed. \nOn some level Stede senses this, and it feeds his fears about Ed getting bored of him, not being enough for the legendary Blackbeard, only dragging him down the boring, domestic spiral he abandoned his family to escape.  We needed more time to determine if Stede could\u2019ve been happy serving the king alongside Ed. I reckon he would, if he\u2019d gotten closure with Mary and realized Ed was (partially) enjoying the change of pace. \nStede associates pirating with freedom the same way Ed links it to boredom, but both recently enjoyed pirating because they enjoyed EACH OTHER. They were part of the solution, not their careers. But as Lucious importantly points out, Ed and Stede don\u2019t need each other to live. That\u2019s partially because their enjoyment of their environments come from applying each other\u2019s philosophies to said environments: Stede with letting his family aid his fuckery, and Edward having a talent show and encouraging his crew.\nAnyway, \u201cgifted kid\u201d Edward is a foil to \u201cI never do anything right no matter how hard I try\u201d Stede, and balancing their mutual satisfactions will be a fascinating rollercoaster for the next seasons.

It is, nonetheless, reliably known as Blackbeard's Bar and Grill and Other Delicacies and Delights and Fishing Equipment-- or \"The Gift Shop\" for short.\nIt's managed by a pair of old codgers who like to daydream, drink over-sugared tea, and tell outrageous lies about their youth. They've named the place for a legend who went missing after his head was cut off in '18, though they'd be the first to say that maybe \"stopped showing up in bars after a very public decapitation, gosh, I wonder why\" was not perhaps the most complicated of mysteries. They won't say why they've named it for him, though-- they don't even seem to be related to the man. So far as anyone can tell, their names are Jeff.\nThe food is decent, the prices reasonable, and anyone maimed on premises gets a free splash of the highest proof booze they have in stock over whatever's still bleeding. But nice as all that is, it's not for any of those reasons that The Gift Shop is the most sought-after eatery in the nautical world-- nor why the Jeffs can largely afford to ignore things like consistent menus or reliable hours.\nNo, the real reason everyone knows to come to this particular little corner of the pirate netherworld is because of, well... The Gift Shop's gift shop.\nThe gift shop of The Gift Shop is filled mostly with fishing equipment, as the place's proper name would suggest. But right by the till, set up in friendly little pyramids as if begging to be added on top of other supplies as last-minute impulse purchase, are dozens of palm-sized tins with printed paper pasted to their lids, each of them reading \"A Delightfull Pomatum FOR Diuerse Ufes, by a Gentle-man's SPECIAL INSTRUCTION.\"\nAs the majority of people who came into the shop were functionally illiterate, it was the accompanying illustration -- of a hand holding a full-sailed ship in its palm -- that really helped give the pomatum it's more commonly held and extremely apt title: \n\"The Seaman's Friend\"\nBecause as it turned out, and regardless of what that one Jeff tended to huff about, while this little tin of scented salve worked well enough on chapped lips, its real \"delightful diverse use\" was as the best bit of slick in the seven seas. \nBetter smelling than goose grease and a hell of a lot more effective than spit, the Seaman's Friend would take care of a man in private or in company, in sickness or in health, whether hauling or heaving or switching as the wind dictated (as Jeff liked to say while nudging Jeff and anyone else standing within reach of his elbows). It lasted for months, smelled like a wet dream's idea of heaven, and was always priced a penny cheaper than the market cost of the snake kebab.\nApothecaries had tried to buy its recipe from the Jeffs; thieves had tried to steal whole boxes of them to resell at an exorbitant cost. Those apothecaries had gone home either empty-handed or with a recipe that was sure to cause unsightly boils; the thieves merely disappeared, to the wide-eyed surprise of the old men who were questioned after the fact. (Thieves? Weird. SO weird. Can we interest you in a kebab?)\nAnd through it all, year after year, the Jeffs sat behind their till, or wandered amongst their dining customers, or just climbed to the roof and sat watching the ocean while The Gift Shop continued buzzing along without them. A delightful and diverse use of their time together, in fact, by some special instruction all their own."}, {"blog_name": "ripkarl", "id": 683448641294417920, "date": "2022-05-05 21:50:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1651787415, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "i have so many feelings about him", "edward teach", "original content"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zunx0Sby6EiEay00", "note_count": 55, "body": "Edward was so brave to sing his sad girl break up song in front of the whole crew can we talk about that "}, {"blog_name": "brbraisingcain", "id": 683379578541146112, "date": "2022-05-05 03:32:32 GMT", "timestamp": 1651721552, "tags": ["If 'don't make your kink everyone else's problem' was a person", "it would be Izzy Hands", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zzkb_wbxsXiXiu00", "note_count": 9, "body": "Izzy Hands is the personification of both the kind of person and the concept I\u2019d like very MOST to repeatedly hit in the face with a brick.

They plan a talent show to make Ed feel better about a breakup. They go out of their way to make a complete stranger feel better about his former crew's mutiny, ffs.\nSo if anyone tried to call it OOC for these characters to be emotional, affectionate, communicative, or supportive in fanfic, we'd just be like \"okay Izzy Hands, calm down.\"\nCharacters canonically talk about their feelings even though some of them (Jim and Black Pete, for example) find it very difficult. They're canonically emotional--not just angry, but happy, sad, afraid, etc--and affectionate. The only character limited in their expression is Izzy, and half the fandom is just itching for him to get some character development. And it makes just as much sense, given the show's propensity for giving characters a chance to grow, to write him reconciling himself to having an emotion now and then as it does to write him never doing so.\nIt's just very refreshing, given how so many shows treat Having Big Messy Emotions as something reserved for deathbeds and weddings, to see a show just go wild with the emotions for nearly every character, all the time."}, {"blog_name": "bruisyfruity", "id": 683284362545987584, "date": "2022-05-04 02:19:07 GMT", "timestamp": 1651630747, "tags": ["ofmd", "tide lines", "text by me"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z1yUtTbxWu7k8W00", "note_count": 2, "body": "they better use wreck of a ship by tide lines in the season 2 of ofmd. it would literally be perfect because it\u2019s sea themed and it could be used to show how they feel broken without each other"}, {"blog_name": "waldosakimbo", "id": 683270992171319296, "date": "2022-05-03 22:46:36 GMT", "timestamp": 1651617996, "tags": ["ofmd", "random thoughts of the blorbos"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zh9T5vbxTrZbiq00", "note_count": 5, "body": "I don't tag this with any proper consistency BUT!

Which of course it makes sense that he initiates the kiss because it\u2019s an action. And Stede shows is feelings through words, and this ends up with fun situations like the moonlight scene where stede doesn\u2019t realize how much his actions are speaking to ed. Or how significant they are. Anyway, the kiss scene is interesting because stede prompts the little what makes ed happy comment because he\u2019s about words!!! But then but then!! We get to the really devastating part of this!! Because when stede leaves, what is ed supposed to believe? What stede said or what he did? Ans he knows that in stede\u2019s world, people say sweet things and they don\u2019t mean them, they\u2019re passive aggressive. So he believes the action, that stede left him, it\u2019s concrete it\u2019s what he knows. And when stede is separated from ed and he hears someone telling him all of these horrible things about himself, without much in the way of verbal reassurance from ed he takes what he knows too. And I\u2019d say for both of them they\u2019ve become each others\u2019 support very quickly, the very easy way ed immediately took to squashing any doubt stede had of being good enough. And the way stede took to telling ed how good he is, how he is not a lost cause and deserves softness and safety.

in a lot of the ways that matter. similar enough that when they start getting to know each other, taking a peek past the outward differences, it's easy for them to slip into a comfortable familiarity because there's this unconscious \"oh, hello, i recognize you\" sort of vibe. \nbut what i keep thinking about is the envy that's layered on top of that. for both of them. because i just. it's so fucking interesting how their self-image clashes with how they're seen by each other. they both have this soft underbelly, a love of comfort and fine things, they both feel everything so deeply. but they \nhandle\n it so differently. \nstede's always been someone who's incapable of hiding who he is. not because he's particularly confident about it, he's not flaunting, he just doesn't have the tools to craft any kind of disguise. he learns all these social rules and tries so hard to follow them but people still see through him and he doesn't have the people skills to know \nwhy\n or \nhow.\n so he doesn't have any other choice but to be himself. \nmeanwhile ed hides so much of himself i'm not sure he even realizes he's doing it half the time. it's second nature. and he sees stede going around just. doing whatever the fuck he wants basically, telling the whole fucking world that he's soft and emotional, an whether he's doing it on purpose or not, ed is deeply in awe of that because it's something he's never been able to do. \nbut at the same time stede \nwants\n to be able to mask like that. he wants to know what it's like to fit in and he sees ed's ability to perform masculinity as something enviable. (\"if i could just be like blackbeard, i'd give all this away\" like. ouch.) i don't think he really sees how miserable it makes ed because he can't see past his own jealousy. he can't comprehend ed wanting to be like him because his whole life he's been a walking target and he doesn't get why \nanyone\n would want that. he's been told over and over again how undesirable his way of being is. \nidk i'm just stuck on stede being someone who didn't have a choice in how the world sees him. he's not being himself because he's brave or self-assured, he's just not good at masking. probably part of why he's so fucking horrified when ed shaves and stops being blackbeard completely. he doesn't see his own vulnerability as a good thing, why would he want that for someone he cares about. he doesn't want ed to be a target too.

A low budget historical romantic comedy that held off big budget mega giant marvel show Moon Knight from the top spot WEEKS after its own conclusion. A show that held that spot via practically NO advertising or promotion by HBO, with the majority simply being word of mouth by fans. A show with NO official merch, that didn't even have its own official socials until weeks after premiering. Number One.\nAnd it's still not renewed. The number one show in a time when even moderate success tends to see renewals before the first season even finishes airing. A show that the cast and crew desperately want to continue, made on a fraction of the budget of the shows it beat out. That just happens to be a show that has unashamed queer rep and gay romance in the first season. What a coincidence. \nRenewing OFMD is admitting that every show that creators had to fight and scratch and beg and compromise to get even the tiniest, rushed, poorly developed queer romance in could have gone all in without all the pageantry. It means there's a market for this content so powerful that word of mouth can outperform advertising- and that every time they've picked what the market supposedly wants over letting their creators be true to their narratives, they've been wrong. \nKeep yelling for a season 2 (and 3 and 4 and however many more we can get). Don't let them wait until something new catches your eye and the hype dies down to cancel it quietly.

Especially Jim and Olu. They\u2019re two of the more competent crew, at least in a conventional sense. Not that the others aren\u2019t competent (Frenchie leading some more cons is 100% on my S2 wishlist), but most of them are also deeply weird in ways that would make them fit in less well on a more traditional ship. You look at Buttons with his moonbathing and Lucius\u2019s total aversion to any work that isn\u2019t writing and Black Pete\u2019s heavily embellished resume and Frenchie playing the lute while the ship\u2019s under attack ... and I love them but you can see how they ended up on the weirdest pirate ship on the ocean. But Jim\u2019s an expert assassin, and Olu clearly has the crew\u2019s collective braincell. It\u2019s clear that the two of them are just on the Revenge because they were running away from Spanish Jackie. They have the skills to do something else, but at the beginning of the season they need they to get away and they need to be somewhere where Jim\u2019s disguise won\u2019t be blown. And the Revenge is what they found.\nI love that these two start out having only each other, and they end with a community around them. After some questions, the crew comes to accept Jim for exactly who they are. The crew are the ones who so clearly see that Olu is the best choice for captain out of all of them. And that community, I think, is part of what helps Olu and Jim be more open with each other as well. We know that they\u2019ve been on the run together for a while. But the Revenge is somewhere where they can just\n be\n instead of running. And once they have space to breathe, Olu can ask Jim questions, and Jim can start to answer. The Revenge brings Jim back to their past, and the Revenge is what Jim decides to return to in the end. \nAt the beginning it\u2019s so clear that these two are just along for the ride because they have to be.

So textually they are first mate and captain which suggests one possible range of power dynamics, and certainly to hear Izzy tell it he is the long-suffering assistant to an increasingly erratic and distracted boss. But they are also (metaphorically) agent/manager and aging rockstar, which is a different power dynamic. AND Izzy is the metaphorical spouse that Ed is uncomfortable in a married state with and the metaphorical toxic ex that he goes back to after Stede breaks his heart. AND they are a white man and a M\u0101ori man with (probably?) similar class experiences but distinctly different racial experiences. Izzy calls Ed \nboss\n and \nBlackbeard\n and \nEdward\n and even \nEd\n. He stands at almost-military attention in front of Ed\u2019s desk and lies to his face about whether Stede knows who Ed is, and he seeks Ed out in private and offers to kill Stede for him, as an act of service and an offer to protect Ed\u2019s reputation, because he \nknows\n Ed doesn\u2019t kill people, and he flat-out ignores Ed\u2019s \nno\n and tries to kill Stede later anyway and is completely confident that Ed won\u2019t stop him even though by their official power dynamic Ed should be able to halt his sword hand with a word. They have a scene together that ends with Ed\u2019s hand around Izzy\u2019s throat and Izzy is in control of that scene the entire time. And it\u2019s all happening at once!

Thunder grumbled steadily, the entire ship heaving and churning in the grasp of waves nearly up to the deck. Timbers groaned and creaked and through the walls of Stede's room, Ed could occasionally hear shouts from a lively game of cards being played in the crew's quarters. The bed squeaked, the sheets rustled, and again \nBOOM\n and a rumble of thunder sounded, accompanied by a flash of purple across their bodies. Stede shifted in place, the action sinking him deeper within Ed, pressing against that point inside of him that made him question his otherwise firm disbelief in God. Ed's mouth opened to pour forth a soft moan as his fingers dug into Stede's sides, lifting himself up and arching his back into his partner's motions.\n\"That feels fucking incredible, mate,\" he murmured, one hand meandering across Stede's slight paunch, his dark eyes watching as Stede sucked in a small gasp.\nThe glass trembled slightly as another huge wave smeared its way heavily up the ship's side. The storm was loud, and dumping a deluge of water from the heavens, but \nThe Revenge\n was in relatively shallow water, and yesterday afternoon's innocuous billowing clouds told Ed that the storm wouldn't last. Again, lightning struck, deep thunder vibrating the entirety of the vessel. Ed looked at Stede's starkly illuminated face and frowned. So much noise, so much chaos around them, and yet not a peep came from Stede as they used the opportunity to pleasure one another. He never made noise when they fucked and Ed found it...odd.\nStede's face was full of concentration as they moved together, his chin wobbling slightly as he raised and lowered himself to press languorous strokes into Ed, their hips coming together in a thatch of curly black and golden hair.\nTagging anyone who wants to participate, idk if anyone wants to be tagged directly in spicy posts lol.

In both cases, you have a sensitive boy/man who buried that sensitivity under a tough facade (and black leather) to survive. And for both of them, the facade became the reality until something happened to uncover the man beneath.\nAnd that\u2019s where they diverge. Because in Edward\u2019s case, the man was greeted with welcome and approval, both by Stede and the crew around them. In fact, it\u2019s only Izzy who truly seeks to hang on to Blackbeard (which is a whole other post about unrequited love and longing.) Calico Jack\u2019s efforts to turn him back to his old ways are seen as childish and Edward\u2019s momentary listening to them proves a disappointment to all.\nBut in Spike\u2019s case, the man was greeted with derision, much as he\u2019d lived his human life. Whether it\u2019s Buffy\u2019s unknowing echo of Cecily\u2019s dismissal or Xander\u2019s disbelief and denial of his very real grief for Joyce, for the most part, when William first shows himself, he\u2019s shoved away. The only ones to really accept him are Joyce and Dawn, who basically don\u2019t count, in the eyes of the Scoobies. Then just as Buffy begins to see William\u2019s true worth, she dies, comes back, and everything goes to hell. (I personally think the whole bathroom scene was WILDLY OOC and could\u2019ve been handled better with an attempted turning, but again, that\u2019s another post.)\nEdward and William really do parallel each other - sensitivity, facade, reveal of sensitivity, and relapse.

He's never really understood it, but he \nwants\n to. \n\"It does look a wee bit silly, doesn't it?\"\n\"Mhmm.\" \nStedes fingers keep working, gently tugging Ed's hair into place, working it into something that he hopes will be beautiful. And isn't that silly of him, to hope for something like that? \n\"... you don't have to do this, you know,\" he mutters. \"It's not like I need my hair in a braid.\"\n\"Who said anything about need?\" Stede's hand lands on his shoulder and squeezes lightly. \"This is about feeling good. Nothing more, nothing less. Well. And looking dashingly handsome, of course.\" \n\"It's that simple, is it?\"\nStede hums. \"It can be.\"\nEd's shoulders ease, and he finds a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He starts shaking his head, then abandons the motion when it tugs on the half-formed braid in Stede's hands. \"You always make it so easy, man. Kind of envy it, if I'm bein' honest.\"\n\u00a0\nStede is quiet for a long minute. Then he says, voice so quiet Ed has to strain to hear him - \"I suppose - it's because not many things in life are. Easy, that is.\" He tugs lightly on the end of the braid and clears his throat. \"But enough of that. You're all done.\"\nEd turns to grin at him, happy to let the conversation steer into safer places. \"Yeah?\"\nStede smiles, and reaches out to tuck one stray lock behind Ed's ear. \"Yeah. Want to go have a look?\"\nEd nods, and makes his way off the bed, groaning at the stiffness in his back and knee. \"Getting too old to be sitting cross legged on a bed anymore, christ.\"\n\"I told you the chair would've been more comfortable.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" He doesn't want to say that he liked it, sitting with Stede's knees brushing the sides of his hips when he leaned back, knowing that if he just kept leaning, he'd fall right into Stede's lap. Stede doesn't need to know how soft Ed is for him. \nBut when he looks in the mirror and sees the shiny red ribbon tied at the end of the braid, exactly the same shade as the bit of silk he\u2019s kept all these years -\u00a0 he thinks that maybe, just maybe, Stede already knows. And maybe, just maybe, Stede is just as soft for him, too. \n\"Lovely,\" Stede says, coming up behind him. Ed swallows down the sudden lump in his throat, reaches his hand back for Stede's hand. \n\"Thanks, mate.\"\n\"Of course, love,\" Stede murmurs, squeezing his hand. He sets his other hand on Ed's shoulder, leans up to brush a kiss against his cheek. \"It was my pleasure.\"\n--\nMany thanks to \n@lovewithagirl\n for the prompt for this one, and also every artist who\u2019s drawn Stede braiding Ed\u2019s hair, I owe you all my life.

I felt it was appropriate. The other half is almost finished, so expect an update soon <: Enjoy <3\nAO3 link\nJust when today was shaping up to be boring and uneventful, Izzy Hands provided some much-needed entertainment. The crew interrupted whatever they were doing to watch him chase a seagull across the deck and bombard it with the vilest insults he could think of. Of course, the bird flew away unscathed, leaving Izzy to bellow the longest \u201c\nFUUUUCK\n!!!\u201d they\u2019d ever heard. He took out a spyglass to follow its path to a nearby passenger ship. Then he hurried over to the closest dinghy\u2013the one stationed behind Pete and Lucius.\n\u201cMove,\u201d he snarled, shoving Pete aside. Pete hated it when he did that, but he was used to it by now. No point in arguing.\n\u201cHavin\u2019 a bit of trouble, \nIggy\n?\u201d Lucius inquired, voice dripping with sarcasm.\n\u2026 at least, one of them thought so.\n\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d Izzy sounded even more homicidal than usual, but he didn\u2019t so much as look at either of them. He was too busy untying the ropes that held the boat in place.\n\u201cWhere did your ring go?\u201d\nRing\u2013? Oh. Pete now realised Izzy was missing the ring that was usually secured to his tie. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t wearing his tie either. Did that seagull swoop in while he was fastening it?\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 piece of shit bird took it. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 it back.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the bottom of the ocean?\u201d\n\u201cFrom \nthere\n.\u201d Izzy gestured impatiently towards the ship. \u201cIt fuckin\u2019 dropped it right as it flew over. Some fucker in green picked it up.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you lucky. That ring must mean a lot to you.\u201d\n\u201cMore than any of your miserable lives.\u201d\n\u201cCharming.\u201d Lucius leant one hand on the rail and the other on his hip. \u201cAnd I suppose you\u2019re going off on your own?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Lucius shrugged, \u201cbut I wonder how \nyou\u2019d \nfeel about getting shot by security the moment you set foot in there.\u201d\nIzzy finally deemed him worthy of a very irritated glance. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed? That ship\u2019s full of aristocrats. Partying it up, no doubt. And while I\u2019m sure you could threaten \nthem\n into giving back your precious ring, the guards won\u2019t be happy about you waving your sword around.\u201d\nIzzy fell silent. Whether there were guns involved remained speculation, but it was true the upper crust wouldn\u2019t venture into pirate-infested waters without some form of security. As brilliant a swordsman as he was, Izzy couldn\u2019t take several men at a time. Walking in there was suicide.\nLucius visibly savoured the defeat on his face. \u201cNo need to fret, Izzy. How about \nI\n fetch you your ring?\u201d\n\u201c\nWhat\n?\u201d It came from both Izzy and Pete this time.\n\u201cY\u2019know that Spanish ship we raided the other day? Ed\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\nBlackbeard\n.\u201d\n\u201c\u2013found an invitation to the party. Neither he nor Stede seem inclined to use it this time, though.\u201d Lucius looked up in thought. \u201cConsidering the last party they went to ended on such a \nhot \nnote, I\u2019m willin\u2019 to bet something interesting happened.\u201d\n\u201cSo \nyou \nwant to infiltrate them this time?\u201d Pete sounded hesitant. \u201cYou sure that\u2019s a good idea, babe?\u201d\nLucius flashed him a grin. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine Izzy\u2019s eager to do it himself, do you?\u201d\nNo; he clearly wasn\u2019t. Izzy was \nseething\n. He closed the distance between himself and Lucius, eyes burning into his, and hissed: \u201cI\u2019d rather \ndie\n than be indebted to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you would.\u201d Lucius patted him casually on the head, and the sight reminded Pete of a cat that was being pushed to its limit. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see any other options for you. No one else is going to mingle with those snobs for your sake\u2013and you know as well as I do that our captains won\u2019t condone an all-out attack for a single ring.\u201d\nFlustered, Izzy swatted his hand away. \u201cAnd why the fuck would \nyou\n do it?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, to have some fun, of course.\u201d Lucius was suddenly looking at Pete. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you, babe?\u201d\nPete blinked. \u201cWhat\u2013? Uh, sure, I guess.\u201d\nIzzy\u2019s suspecting eyes darted between them. He was contemplating. Ultimately, he refocused on Lucius.\u00a0\n\u201cI want your word that you won\u2019t use this against me.\u201d\n\u201cYou have it.\u201d Lucius\u2019s hand fluttered to his chest as he dipped into a neat little bow. That just added to the colour in Izzy\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\u201c\u2013well, get on it then,\u201d he grumbled, and he scurried out of the conversation.\nLucius smiled at Pete, and he smiled back, although he was more confused than anything. He didn\u2019t understand why a simple ring meant so much to a man like Izzy, nor did he see how associating with a bunch of hoity-toities could be remotely \u201cfun\u201d.\nAs always, though, Lucius seemed to have the answers. Pete was curious enough to follow his lead. If there\u2019s one thing Lucius was good at, it\u2019s making things \ninteresting\n.\n-\nConvincing Stede required a bit of effort. He was reluctant to send members of his crew into a nest of aristocrats, and Ed, lounging behind him, didn\u2019t seem to care one way or the other. Only when they mentioned Izzy\u2019s ring did his ears perk and his attention shift to the conversation.\n\u201cLet \u2018em do it, mate,\u201d he said, and no more was needed to sway Stede in their favour\u2013on two conditions. One: they had to be careful. And two: they \nhad\n to let him lend his clothes for the occasion. Neither Lucius nor Pete considered the latter an issue, seeing as that was part of the plan anyway. The former was a given. Probably.\n-\nOne dress-up session later, two handsome chaps were ready to go. Pete was wearing a powdered wig at Stede\u2019s insistence, after he\u2019d explained (as tactfully as possible) that rich people didn\u2019t look too fondly on baldness. Pete didn\u2019t mind; it made him feel even more like a secret agent, deceiving those morons in plain sight.\nHe let Lucius handle the porter and followed him inside, where an unfamiliar world awaited them. Everything was so \nbright\n, and \nshiny\n, and \nchique\n. They were surrounded by overdressed strangers who pecked each other\u2019s cheeks and spoke in languages he didn\u2019t understand. Pete immediately felt like a fish out of water. By contrast, Lucius looked completely composed, as if he attended one of these parties on a daily basis.\nHe shot Pete a playful grin. \u201cReady to have some fun?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Izzy\u2019s ring?\u201d\nLucius shrugged. \u201cScrew Izzy. We\u2019re doing him a massive favour; he can afford to wait a while. Now, what do you want to do? Those hors d'oeuvres look good.\u201d\n\u201cThose what?\u201d\n\u201cSnacks, babe.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Pete scanned the table. Even the food looked foreign, but admittedly delectable.\nHowever, the notion of eating was forgotten when Pete\u2019s eye fell on the next room: the ball room, where people were dancing a familiar dance. Thanks to Lucius, Pete knew the ins and outs by now. This was the perfect opportunity to show him.\nLike a gentleman, he lifted his hand for Lucius to take. \u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d\nLucius took his hand with a smile. \u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d\nThe couple entered the room and got into position. Seeing as Pete was the initiator, Lucius let him take the lead. And he didn\u2019t disappoint: Pete guided him a flawless Waltz, every step perfectly in tune with the music. The confident smile on his face was a far cry from their early lessons, where his clumsiness occasionally resulted in flattening Lucius\u2019s foot. But now, he danced like he\u2019d been born for it, not a hint of hesitance in his eyes.\u00a0\nLucius beamed with pride. His boyfriend looked so handsome\u2013so\n sexy\n\u2013when he knew what he was doing. He twirled out and back in, but whispered in Pete\u2019s ear before they could continue: \u201cDo you want to try something else?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got in mind?\u201d Pete whispered back.\n\u201cYou up for a little Tango?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure I got that one down yet. Besides, do you really think it\u2019s the type of dance for\u2013\nthis\n crowd?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s not. I\n want\n them to look at us.\u201d Lucius stepped back and Pete saw the look on his face had changed. He was eager. \nExcited\n. \u201cJust follow my lead, babe.\u201d\nPete was happy to oblige. He hadn\u2019t quite perfected his footwork for this dance, but boy, did he enjoy it. The Tango was quick, passionate, and best of all: \nsensual\n. They weren\u2019t exactly wearing the most suitable outfits for such fast-paced moves, but they didn\u2019t care. Pete and Lucius performed for no one but each other, and both men liked what the other had to offer. This was no longer a simple dance. Every look and every step was deliberate. Whenever their bodies connected, a spark\u2013a \ndesire\n\u2013surged through them that was yet unfulfilled.\u00a0\nThey finished in each other\u2019s arms, panting and sweating and grinning. At this point, everybody really\n was\n looking at them. They\u2019d formed a circle to watch the pair in either awe or sheer scandilisation. Pete\u2019s expression only grew more amused at the gasping and murmuring around them. He wanted to press a kiss on Lucius\u2019s lips to \nreally\n rub it in, but they\u2019d pushed the limit as it was. They were lucky if they didn\u2019t get kicked out after that provocative display.\nLucius seemed to have a similar thing in mind.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he whispered, and Pete followed him out of the room, leaving their dumbstruck audience behind. They crept into the hallway and waited until it was abandoned to open the door to an empty office. Lucius shut it, threw the lock, and pushed himself hungrily up against his boyfriend.\n\u201cNever seen you care that much about privacy before,\u201d Pete teased, although he had to admit the sneaking around added a new flavour of excitement. The lock on the door provided a safety net, but they still had to be quiet so as not to raise suspicion. That made Pete want to pester Lucius all the more; \nreally\n drive him crazy and watch him try his hardest to keep his lips sealed.\nFor now, though, those lips locked with his own. Pete pressed Lucius against the wall and picked him up by the thighs, while Lucius threw his arms as well as his legs around him. Pete could already feel Lucius\u2019s excitement down below and smirked when he ripped off his wig and tossed it somewhere so he could cling to his bare head. Lucius was such an attentive lover when he took charge, but Pete quite enjoyed seeing his needy side, too.\n\u201cTake me, Pete,\u201d Lucius breathed impatiently against his lips.\n\u201cAll in good time, babe.\u201d Pete gave his ear a little nibble and got the desired effect: Lucius just barely managed to contain a moan. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to have \nfun\n.\u201d\n\u201cYou tease,\u201d Lucius scolded, but he cocked his head to the side to give Pete as much space as he wanted."}, {"blog_name": "aborted-fetus-gummy", "id": 683332013254639616, "date": "2022-05-04 14:56:30 GMT", "timestamp": 1651676190, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "why am i like this tho", "oranges", "teal oranges"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZMSvjVbxhjXviW00", "note_count": 6, "body": "this stupid fucking pirate show, we\u2019re eating oranges in class and I want to cry"}, {"blog_name": "cocaptainsinlove", "id": 683070431201312768, "date": "2022-05-01 17:38:46 GMT", "timestamp": 1651426726, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "stede bonnet", "blackbonnet", "edward teach", "stedward", "stede and ed", "ed and stede"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZKnt0SbwmF0eKy00", "note_count": 23, "body": "what if stede and ed had exchanged lockets with each other's hair.

One thing that\u2019s seems undisputed is that when Ed invokes the act of grace and joins the navy, he\u2019s making a sacrifice for Stede. I want to interrogate that a little because it seems to me that Ed remains consistently self-serving to the very end.\u00a0\nFirst, we have to look at what Ed wants: Novelty. He repeatedly talks about or shows how bored he is with life, how he wants something new and exciting. From the very first, before they even meet, he looks to Stede as a beacon of hope; something new and unexpected. We know he first became interested in meeting Stede because he bested Izzy on that island in episode 2. Izzy\u2019s a highly skilled swordsman, a good strategist, Blackbeard\u2019s righthand man, and some random guy no one\u2019s heard of outwits him. Ed\u2019s interest is piqued. He becomes more intent on meeting him after Stede rejects an audience with Blackbeard  (unknowingly, but Ed doesn\u2019t know that). Why? Because Ed\u2019s used to getting his way, he\u2019s used to people being afraid of him, and bending to his will. We see this when he snaps at the crew in e4, and when he talks about how boring pirating has become because people see him and surrender immediately, and in e6 we see just how true that is during the fuckery.\u00a0\nWhen he does meet Stede, the latter provides Ed with progressively more novel experiences. He isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s idea of a pirate, he wears fancy clothes, his ship is an elegant but deeply impractical cabinet of curiosities; he gives Ed marmalade and introduces him to high society and, perhaps most significantly, he tries to make Ed happy. Unlike everyone else he doesn\u2019t do it because he\u2019s scared of Blackbeard, or because Blackbeard gave him and order, he does it because he \nwants\n to, and that in itself is a novel experience for Ed. In e7, Ed is an impatient, unwilling participant in Stede\u2019s treasure hunt right up until Lucius tells him that he\u2019s doing it \nfor\n Ed, because he \nlikes\n Ed. I\u2019d wager that being liked is a novel idea for Ed too - he\u2019s used to Blackbeard being feared and respected, and he gets on with other pirates like Jack well enough, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s experienced someone really liking him before.\u00a0\nThe idea that someone\u2019s doing something for him just because they want you inspires the first act of reciprocity we see from Ed; he immediately becomes more enthusiastic about the treasure hunt, almost assuming the role of an indulgent (albeit, humorously patronising) caregiver. However, he remains entirely uninterested in the \nmaterial\n objective of the hunt; he\u2019s just thrilled that the primary goal is his happiness. That he makes Stede happy by being happy himself is, I think, still secondary - more of a happy coincidence than anything else. But it does introduce him to the idea of caring about someone other than himself - yet another novel experience, and one he becomes increasingly invested in.\u00a0\nWhich brings me, finally, to the notion of Ed\u2019s sacrifice. What is meant to be sacrificing, exactly? His life of piracy? He\u2019s bored of that, he wants something else, he says so time and time again. One could argue that when he invokes the act of grace and joins the navy, he\u00a0 sacrifices his own death. If we recall, he is momentarily taken with the idea of death as an escape from his boredom in e4. But he gets exactly what he\u2019s wanted from the very beginning anyway; a new life, new experiences, to not know what\u2019s coming next. He says as much when he and Stede are on the beach; in saving Stede he saved himself too. If he sacrifices anything for Stede, it\u2019s his future in the navy; he had no plans to escape, they kiss, he decides to escape - ostensibly because Stede wants to. However, as shown above, Stede is Ed\u2019s greatest novelty. He doesn\u2019t plan their escape merely because Stede desired it, he plans it so that they can continue to be together, experiencing new things. It\u2019s not a selfless act.\u00a0\nThis, I think, is why Stede\u2019s betrayal in e9 hits him so hard; after so much\u00a0\u201csacrifice\u201d he has gained nothing, he\u2019s right back to where he started: an outlaw with a boat, his greatest escape from mundanity gone.\u00a0"}, {"blog_name": "vitruvianwatson", "id": 683369458337742848, "date": "2022-05-05 00:51:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1651711901, "tags": ["blackbonnet", "edward teach", "stede bonnet", "ofmd", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZHKaxvbxqERMae00", "note_count": 58, "body": "You\u2019ll never convince me Ed wasn\u2019t \ntrying\n to make Stede pick the bit of stuff out of his beard for him.

Water and water adjacent things used to cleanse is when a character is letting go of something versus a rebirth of sorts which would be much more revelational for the character (it\u2019s like the something something you need to kill the person you were born to be to become the person you want to be Rocketman quote).\u00a0\nThe show has had several instances where water has been used as a method of rebirth or cleansing for a character, but honestly I\u2019m lazy and don\u2019t feel like unpacking all of that right now. So we\u2019re only unpacking episode six today.\u00a0\nAnyways, in the episode when it is revealed that Ed is the Kraken it happens from the safety of Stede\u2019s bathtub which is literally so important. The ever so feared pirate, Blackbeard, is sitting in a bathtub and revealing his deepest secret to another man. The symbolism of him sitting in this tub is just him \u201ccleansing\u201d himself of his \u201csins\u201d and is letting go of all these things for the sake of being loved.\nIt\u2019s like that tumblr post about how wanting to be loved is just being able to embarrass yourself enough to be able to ask for it, or the New York Times goat article about the mortifying ordeal of being known. To be loved we need to be perceived and in this moment, Ed was allowing himself to be perceived by Stede.\nHe sees himself as a monster, which is where I feel like this idea of him being the Kraken comes from. Ed believes love comes from violence and that he is only worthy of affection when it involves pain (See: the \u201crun me through\u201d scene), and yet there\u2019s someone right in front of him who sees the opposite. Stede sees him as someone worthy of good and gentle things, not just pain and violence.\nAt the beginning of the episode Ed says, \u201cTurn your enemies' worst fear against them and you\u2019ll own them,\u201d and his own worst fear was the Kraken.\u00a0Ed let his own fears own him for his entire life and all it took for him to let that go, was for another person to allow him to be who he is. Without the violence and the anger, someone who calls him out on his bullshit. Someone who makes him happy.\nPlus, this bathtub scene literally opens up so much for a scene in season two where we get Ed back in the bathtub but this time Stede is helping him bathe. It\u2019s like the line in Les Mis, \u201cto love another person is to see the face of God,\u201d but God is actually Stede Bonnet and he\u2019s helping his boyfriend wash away his \u201csins\u201d. It\u2019s almost like Stede is giving him \u201cpermission\u201d to be himself again, he\u2019s basically saying that he\u2019s here and he isn\u2019t leaving.\nAs dyl (\n@lucius-spriggs\n) once said, \u201cI really love it when Christian symbology is used for queer intimacy\u201d. So true.\nTL;DR - Ed telling Stede everything from the tub was him cleansing himself of his sins and is now born again. He is a new man post ep. 6\nRead this on my Substack"}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683075962348453888, "date": "2022-05-01 19:06:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1651432001, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbwnVVwOq00", "note_count": 0, "body": "Soft\nby \nFyre\nYou really couldn\u2019t tell what the captain would do, not when it boiled down to it.

Right. Yes. Please, have a seat.\u201d\nLucius watched, warily, as Stede physically removed Blackbeard\u2019s hand from his side. Blackbeard\u2019s attention still did not waver from Stede.\n\u201cEdward, we\u2019ll just be a few minutes,\u201d Stede said.\nBlackbeard growled and got up from the couch and glared at Lucius on his way out.\nStede smiled at Lucius and said, \u201cHe\u2019s lovely, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\nLucius raised his eyebrows in surprise. He waited for Stede to laugh or say he was joking, but he didn\u2019t. He only offered Lucius sincerity, so Lucius said, \u201cYes, Cap\u2019n, he\u2019s\u2026great.\u201d\n*\nFrenchie and Oluwande were sitting outside on the deck of the French ship, counting up the earnings from their pyramid scheme when Blackbeard stormed out of the party, Stede close on his heels.\nThey went to the opposite railing, giving Frenchie and Oluwande a perfect view of whatever argument they seemed to be having. Blackbeard pulled out his gun, and Stede put his hand on it and pushed it down until Blackbeard relented. He sat down on a barrel and deflated, and Stede took a step toward him and put a hand on his shoulder, seemingly speaking gently to him.\nBlackbeard was looking down at the deck, but then Stede pushed a stray lock of his hair back behind his ear and Blackbeard\u2019s head popped up. He looked up at Stede for a second like he was making a decision, then he grabbed Stede\u2019s hand and held it against his cheek, leaning into his palm.\nFrenchie and Oluwande looked at each other.\n\u201cYou ever spent any one-on-one time with Blackbeard?\u201d Frenchie asked.\nOluwande looked back toward Stede and Blackbeard as he answered, \u201cYeah. Once. He\u2019s real weird, babe. Felt like he could go from being my best friend to throwing me overboard in the span of a conversation. It was so scary and disorientating, I couldn\u2019t catch my breath for, like, several minutes afterward.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Frenchie hummed, also turning his attention back to Stede and Blackbeard. \nThey were standing side-by-side now, looking out over the railing toward the water, and Blackbeard had his legs crossed in such a way that he could swing the heel of his foot back and forth, tapping Stede\u2019s calf.\n\u201cD\u2019you think Bonnet feels that way right now?\u201d Frenchie asked. \u201cDisorientated, scared, his guard up?\u201d\nOluwande laughed loudly.\n*\nJim might have gotten a little carried away during the fuckery, as evidenced by the cleanup taking so long that they were the last one in the captain\u2019s quarters after everyone else had gone up to the main deck.\nThey were heading toward the stairs when they heard Bonnet speaking in a soft voice. Jim followed the sound and saw the bathroom door halfway open and Bonnet sitting on a stool by the tub. He put his hand on the side of it, and suddenly Blackbeard was in view, too, his head tilting to the side to rest against Bonnet\u2019s hand. Jim was confused as to why Blackbeard would be sitting fully clothed in a washtub with no water, but they certainly weren\u2019t curious enough to find out the answer. So they tried to leave again, but then Blackbeard came up out of the tub and wrapped his arm around the back of Bonnet\u2019s neck and Jim reached for their knife just in case\u2014\nAnd then they relaxed when they saw Bonnet put his arms around Blackbeard to embrace him. Bonnet turned his head into Blackbeard\u2019s hair and continued speaking in a soft voice, and Blackbeard gripped the back of his shirt tightly. \nJim had a lot of questions but didn\u2019t really want to know the answers, so they left without being noticed.\n*\nSleeping in a hammock on the main deck meant that Wee John usually woke with the light of the morning sun. The morning after the fuckery, though, he woke before sunrise to the sound of whispers near the mast.\nHis eyes quickly adjusted to the low light, enough for him to make out Stede pinned to the mast by Izzy Hands\u2019 sword in his gut, and Blackbeard standing in front of him with his gloved hand wrapped around the blade.\n\u201cJust a slow tug, like we did the other night,\u201d Blackbeard whispered soothingly, as Stede winced in pain.\n\u201cNo, no, Edward, no,\u201d Stede argued. He put his hand on Blackbeard\u2019s shoulder and unsuccessfully dug his fingers into the leather before frantically fisting a lock of Blackbeard\u2019s hair and twisting it around his hand. \u201cSorry. Sorry. Need\u2014need leverage.\u201d\nBlackbeard huffed a laugh and put his free hand on Stede\u2019s abdomen, right above the wound. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, love. Breathe. You can pull my hair all you want, but not the beard. Ready? Just a little tug.\u201d\nStede made a pathetic whimpering noise and yanked Blackbeard\u2019s hair so hard that Blackbeard\u2019s face came within inches of his. They stayed like that, eyes locked, so close their noses were almost touching, as Blackbeard slowly removed the sword.\nWee John looked from side to side at the Swede and Roach, but they were both sound asleep in their hammocks, so he was left as the sole witness to the ridiculousness before him.\nAs the sword slid out of Stede\u2019s abdomen, both he and Blackbeard sighed with relief. Blackbeard immediately put his hand over the wound and pressed hard against it, and Stede\u2019s hand covered over top of his to help. They were still so close. Blackbeard put his other hand on Stede\u2019s cheek and patted it twice.\nThen he leaned forward and whispered, \u201cYou did good,\u201d before pressing a kiss to Stede\u2019s forehead.\nThey carefully walked together toward the captain\u2019s cabin.\nWee John once again looked around for anybody who might be awake. Like a ghost, Buttons was up, standing by the railing on the poop deck, and he locked eyes with Wee John and slowly nodded his head twice.\n*\nLucius knew he had the time right. It was the same every day as long as they were at sea and not on some adventure. So he warily stepped into the captain\u2019s quarters with his notebook and quill in hand and peered around for Stede.\n\u201cCap\u2019n?\u201d he asked, wincing. \u201cDo you need me to take notes today? If you\u2019re busy, I\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d\nThe wall to Stede\u2019s auxiliary wardrobe opened, and Stede came out looking flushed and smiley. He was wearing an elaborate orange coat, but it was open to reveal that he was shirtless underneath and wearing Blackbeard\u2019s leather pants.\nStede stammered out an apology that Lucius didn\u2019t hear because he was distracted by Blackbeard coming out of the wardrobe right behind Stede. He had his hair up in a very neat bun and was wearing light blue breeches and white stockings, and no shirt or shoes.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Stede asked as Blackbeard slipped past him toward the door.\nBlackbeard looked at Lucius then at Stede. \u201cI was gonna take a piss off the side of the ship.\u201d\n\u201cDressed like that?\u201d Stede asked condescendingly.\n\u201cI\u2019m Blackbeard, mate, people aren\u2019t allowed to question anything I do.\u201d\nStede rolled his eyes. \u201cEd, you don\u2019t know how to do the laces.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Right.\u201d Blackbeard walked over to Stede and stood right in front of him.\nStede, casually, put his hands on the laces near Blackbeard\u2019s crotch.\n\u201cBelly,\u201d Stede whispered like some kind of command, and Blackbeard, insanely, pushed the little pudge of his belly up and out of Stede\u2019s way.\nLucius demurely averted his eyes.\n\u201cThere ya go,\u201d Stede said sweetly, and Lucius looked back again to see Stede pat Blackbeard\u2019s hip then pinch a bit of his belly fat between his thumb and index finger. \u201cCool scar.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, man.\u201d Blackbeard ran the backs of his knuckles along Stede\u2019s jawline and then turned on his heel and left, nodding at Lucius on his way out.\n\u201cHave a seat, Lucius, we can get started,\u201d Stede said, like there was nothing amiss.\n\u201cCap\u2019n, don\u2019t you think you should\u2014would you like to, maybe, change? Change your clothes.\u201d\nStede looked down at himself and startled a bit. \u201cOh my, I forgot I was wearing this.\u201d He looked back up at Lucius and smiled. \u201cEdward and I were doing a bit of a fashion show.\u201d\n\u201cMm-hmm, yeah, I get it,\u201d Lucius said dismissively. \u201cChange your clothes, Cap\u2019n.\u201d\n*\nAs rumors spread among the crew, everyone became a little more wary around Stede and Blackbeard. \nLucius only went into the captain\u2019s cabin once he had absolute verbal confirmation after knocking. He subtly hinted to everyone else that they should do the same.\nFrenchie cornered Oluwande and Jim one afternoon and practically begged them not to start having sex in public sections of the ship because it would be too much to try to avoid walking in on \nthree\n different couples. This happened two days after he walked in on Lucius and Black Pete, and seven minutes after he walked in on Stede and Blackbeard in the recreation room wearing undergarments and lounging on the floor together with lazy smiles on their faces.\n(Oluwande and Jim both protested too much, laughed too forcefully at the idea that they were interested in sleeping with each other. Frenchie ignored them.)\nThe Swede claimed he saw Stede and Blackbeard kiss one evening after everyone had gone to bed\u2014or, at least, they seemed to be about to kiss. Heading toward a kiss. And they both had a look in their eye like they were going to do a lot more than kissing, so the Swede climbed up into the crow\u2019s nest to get away from them.\nFang said Izzy actually overheard them fucking before he left, that the noises they were making right there on the main deck of the ship in the middle of the night were unambiguously sexual.\n*\nButtons was basking in moon glow with Karl one quiet evening when Blackbeard appeared like smoke next to him, not saying a word and not even looking over at him. Buttons watched out of the corner of his eye as Blackbeard undid the clasp of his trousers, unlaced his boots and removed his shirts until he was fully naked.\nBlackbeard seemed to have no qualms about his body, so Buttons took a quick peek at it just to satisfy his curiosity about the expanse of tattoos all over his chest, arm, back and legs, the tableau of scars over a good portion of his tan skin. He respectfully avoided looking too closely past the thick black hair around his groin. \nStede came out of the captain\u2019s cabin wearing just a robe and called out, \"Edward! What the hell are you doing?\"\nBlackbeard turned his head to look over his shoulder at Stede, then he spread his arms out to the sides and said, \"Moon glow, mate. You should try it sometime.\"\n\"Aye,\" Buttons agreed.\nStede mumbled something under his breath before going back to his cabin.\nBlackbeard made eye contact with Buttons, smiled devilishly, and winked.\n*\nRoach was counting out the oranges and wondering how he was going to break the news to the captain that they needed to make a stop to get more when Bonnet and Blackbeard walked into the mess with teacups in their hands. \nRoach started to say something, but Bonnet and Blackbeard didn\u2019t see him over in the kitchen, so he went back to his oranges.\nThey were distracting, though. They stood near a window with their shoulders leaned up against the wall facing each other, and they kept laughing and raising their voices. Blackbeard said something about his tea being perfect, then he held the cup up to Bonnet\u2019s lips and tipped a sip into his mouth for him before bringing the cup back to his own lips. A minute later, Roach heard a saucer touching down on a table and he looked over to see Blackbeard\u2019s hands now free, now reaching for Bonnet\u2019s hip, now rubbing back and forth and teasing at the fabric of his shirt. \n\u201cCaptain,\u201d Roach said impulsively.\n\u201cYes,\u201d they both answered, turning toward him.\nBlackbeard dropped his hand away from Bonnet\u2019s hip slowly and apologized for presuming to be captain.\nRoach told Bonnet about the oranges.\n*\nLucius did not want to be stuck in the woods with Stede and Blackbeard when they were both in foul moods and not getting along with each other.\nHe watched Stede clean a bit of snake out of Blackbeard\u2019s beard. He said, \u201cOh my god.\u201d\n*\nOne night on the main deck, storytime ended with everyone breaking off into their own conversations and staying up way past bedtime. Frenchie was sitting with Wee John, Lucius and Black Pete and was hemming trousers for the Swede when Wee John said, \u201cThat\u2019s a bit queer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nFrenchie looked up from his work and followed Wee John\u2019s line of sight to the doorway of the captain\u2019s cabin, where Stede was sitting on a crate behind Blackbeard, who was sitting on the deck. Stede was concentrating very hard on splitting up Blackbeard\u2019s hair into parts to braid it.\n\u201cDepends on what definition of queer you mean, mate,\u201d Frenchie replied. He then frowned and said, \u201cActually, it really doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHas anyone actually, you know,\u201d Wee John began. \u201cHas anyone walked in on them\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cGoing at it?\u201d Lucius finished for him. \u201cVery nearly, but no.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed we\u2019ve all managed to avoid it,\u201d Frenchie added. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem very interested in privacy.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d Black Pete said righteously. \u201cWhen I worked for Blackbeard\u2014\u201d\nEveryone simultaneously groaned.\n\u201c\u2014I saw him cut a man\u2019s finger off just for accidentally touching his hair.\u201d\n\u201cActually, Pete\u2019s right,\u201d Lucius said.\n\u201cThanks, babe.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, babe. Ed was sitting next to me on the couch one day while I was taking notes, and my arm brushed up against his hair and he freaked. I thought he might rip my face off.\u201d\nThey all watched Blackbeard cross his legs and wrap his arms around his knees and tilt his head back and close his eyes and lean into the press of Stede\u2019s fingers through his hair.\nWee John said, \u201cSometimes I think we could mutiny and they wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d\nStede finished a braid and smoothed it down before moving onto another section of hair. Blackbeard touched the braid and frowned. Clearly realizing how terrible Stede was at fixing his hair, Blackbeard started to gesture with both hands in the air, miming the movements of braiding and explaining to Stede how to do it properly, all while Stede fumbled his locks between his fingers. \n\u201cNah, I don\u2019t want to mutiny,\u201d Frenchie said, smiling. \u201cI like working for them.\u201d\nLucius and Wee John hummed their agreement. Black Pete scoffed half-heartedly.\n*\nWhen Calico Jack showed up and Stede looked at him with murder in his eyes, the crew shared one collective silent conversation that boiled down to, \nLet\u2019s just get through this.\n*\n\u201cBlackbeard will no longer be sailing with us,\u201d Stede announced the morning after Blackbeard left the Revenge with Calico Jack.\nEveryone was extremely hungover, but alert enough to voice their disappointment. Oluwande, who had spent all night on the captain\u2019s couch listening to him mutter to himself as he spied on Blackbeard through the window, felt like he had a solid enough reading of the situation to say something.\nSo he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t just let him leave, Cap\u2019n. You have to win him back.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Cap\u2019n,\u201d Frenchie agreed. \u201cYou two are too in love to just let it end like this.\u201d\nThe color drained from Stede\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026What did you say?\u201d\nEveryone exchanged confused looks. Lucius spoke up.\n\u201cMaybe you haven\u2019t gotten far enough into your relationship to use that phrase yet, but we can all see it, Cap\u2019n. It doesn\u2019t have to end like this.\u201d\n\u201cBlackbeard and I aren\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t\u2014we\u2019re not\u2026\u201d Stede stammered. Then he looked off into the distance and his face changed with realization. \u201cOh, fuck. We are.\u201d\nThere were murmurs among the crew, the awkward realization that they\u2019ve spent weeks understanding what was going on while Stede and Blackbeard \ndidn\u2019t \nunderstand what was going on.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Stede repeated, dropping his head.\nAnd then the English showed up, and Stede was about to make a suicidal decision when Blackbeard appeared at the side of the ship, soaking wet, yelling at them to hoist the white flag.\n\u201cEd,\u201d Stede said, and it sounded like a prayer.\nThe entire crew watched as their captain marched to the side of the ship, hauled Blackbeard onto the deck and kissed him so hard that their teeth made a clacking sound when they knocked together.\nBlackbeard fitted his hands around Stede\u2019s hips and pulled their bodies flush against each other and kissed him sloppily, occasionally stopping to mumble, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d over and over.\nThe English had to quite literally pry them apart.\n*\nAfter Blackbeard called for an act of grace, he rushed over to Stede and pulled his blindfold off and cupped his face in his hand, then he kissed him, gently, and closed his eyes and pressed their foreheads together.\nIt was the last time the crew of the Revenge saw Stede and Blackbeard together for many months.\n*\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird that we thought they were together before,\u201d Frenchie said, later, when everything had finally settled down and Stede was back and Blackbeard was regrowing his beard and they had worked out their issues.\n\u201cWell, we didn\u2019t know any better,\u201d Lucius said.\nUp in the crow\u2019s nest, Edward was sitting behind Stede, legs cocooning his hips, arms wrapped around his torso, mouth glued to his neck. Stede had one hand over top of Edward\u2019s forearm and the other hand on his knee. It was early morning, and they were both wearing floral silk robes.\nThis was actually one of the more modest positions they had taken lately. Every member of the crew had walked in on them, in various parts of the ship, in various stages of undress, during any number of intimate and sexual acts.

Six months passed since he\u2019d found his way back to The Revenge. The days blended completely, a reality that was somehow worsened for stretches at a time because, he soon realized, he wasn\u2019t sleeping. He was grateful when his body finally gave out from pure exhaustion every couple days, because it lulled him into a sudden and dreamless sleep. He\u2019d remembered, with a dry and humorless laugh, offering the possibility of death as the next big adventure to Izzy. He didn\u2019t think that anymore, and found that big surprising. Surely death would seem all the more appealing now, but something nagged in his head. \nI need to prove I don\u2019t need him.\nThe crew seemed to be enjoying themselves. When Izzy wasn\u2019t barking orders, which was admittedly more rare than anyone would have liked to see, there was a generally agreed upon sense of ease. Frenchie and Jim were even beginning to accept the hand fate dealt them. Of course, this acceptance was only the byproduct of deep feelings of defeat, but they found some comfort in whispering stories and jokes to one another in an attempt to keep the other going. Originally, Jim advocated for a realistic view of the situation with the reasoning that it would save both of them from any kind of desperate hope. They tried that, for a time, but it became almost immediately evident that that wasn\u2019t doing either of them any good. So instead, at night, they'd point to stars and try to remember the constellations Stede taught the crew about. This activity brought forth stories, like Jim and Olu up after dark and accidentally finding themselves in the same part of the ship Buttons would moon bathe in, or Roach interrupting Stede\u2019s lesson to argue that there\u2019s no way that one\u2019s a bear and causing a tense debate among the rest of the crew, much to Stede\u2019s disapproval.\nEach night, while Frenchie and Jim pointed out the stars and joked, below decks the dread pirate Blackbeard stared blindly at a landscape portrait of a lighthouse. At first, it caused nothing but heavy sobs, but, as he realized now, it filled him with a profound numbness. It hurt so much to look at that the pain somehow canceled itself out. The blending of the days happened so seamlessly that this previously nighttime-exclusive activity became something he did every moment the crew was not engaged in a raid on another vessel. He found he liked the plundering even more now, because it was the only time he felt anything: a pure, blind rage. The rage he had at the world had a purpose there, and could be taken out on nameless victims. He didn\u2019t have to humanize himself, either: he became a creature that relied on muscle memory alone.\nSix months. Six months that felt instead like a series of excruciatingly long days. One the sixth month and the 15th day, Ivan appeared in the doorway, pale and sweating. The crew knew to never seek out Blackbeard, and to instead wait for him to come to them. Izzy was the only person to enter his quarters, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily Blackbeard\u2019s choice: it was simply necessary to grant him access. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d His voice croaked. It was jagged from disuse, and speaking low, he could feel the itch in his throat from the strain screaming during raids caused. Ivan kept starting sentences and losing the words halfway through. Blackbeard stood, storming toward him with the utmost purpose. \u201cWe need you,\u201d he said finally, when the other pirate was within arm\u2019s reach.\nOne the main deck stood Stede. Izzy\u2019s sword was firmly pressing into his Adam's apple, Izzy himself caught mid-shout: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare help them up!\u201d Fang held a rope ladder and was in the process of unfurling it to throw over the edge. \u201cEd\u2026\u201d Stede said helplessly. He sounded tired, and relieved, and delighted, and scared. It was too much to handle. He wanted to let out all the rage he\u2019d been letting propel him from one day to another, and realized with the greatest frustration that none of it wanted to come out. He was stuck: Blackbeard would scream and thrust the hilt of Izzy\u2019s sword, pushing the blade through the man\u2019s neck, but Edward felt the bile rising in his throat. He could feel his eyes start to sting and wanted nothing more than to scream out all the hurt. \nYou left me!\n He wanted to shout, imagining the tears streaming down his face and streaking the charcoal around his eyes to leave. \nYou promised! You promised and then you left me!\nHe stood, silent. After what felt like an eternity, he said \u201cCome.\u201d Turning on his heel, he headed back into the quarters. The rest of the men were left alone on the deck, glancing between themselves, all in a state of shock. Even Izzy froze where he stood for a moment before leading Stede roughly after the captain. In the doorway, Blackbeard looked up. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Izzy stumbled through an explanation, shutting up in an instant at the cold look he was at the receiving end of. \u201cJust shout if you need me,\u201d he offered quietly, backing out of the room.\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\nEd couldn\u2019t face him yet. He stood, his back to the doorway, and stared at the lighthouse. He realized numbly that this might be the first time he\u2019d actually really looked at it. \u201cI threw your things into the ocean. All of it,\u201d he said. It was intended to be hurtful, as if he were rubbing salt into some kind of wound. The problem with this was that he couldn\u2019t imagine a wound Stede would be carrying. He wasn\u2019t the one abandoned. He turned, expecting to see the Gentleman Pirate inspecting the room he used to call home. Instead, he was staring directly into his eyes. He hadn\u2019t taken eyes off of Ed since he first followed Ivan out of this very room.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHe hated him, and then hated himself even more to realize he didn\u2019t hate him at all. He turned back to the painting, and walked with purpose to the bed, clutching one of the few pillows and throwing it at Stede with all his strength. Despite it only being a pillow, the pirate using all of his strength would knock the wind out of anyone regardless of projectile. Stede accepted the blow, recovering almost immediately. He realized he was angry that Stede could look at him with such sadness and such understanding. He looked at him with so much love.\nKnowing he couldn\u2019t shout at the risk of jeopardizing the image he\u2019d built up again, he moved until he was within inches of Stede\u2019s face. \u201cYou \nleft\n me.\u201d He said it between gritted teeth, each word a hiss. His eyes were wild. \u201c\nYou made me think you fucking cared about me\n.\u201d\nStede set his jaw, silently praying for the other man to yell, to scream at him like he deserved. In his time on the tiny boat, bringing the rest of his crew home, he played this moment in his head over and over. I deserve anything and everything he does to me. He repeated this mantra day and night, following the rhythm of the oars. \u201cI do care about you. Of course I care about you.\u201d\n\u201cLiar!\u201d Ed\u2019s frustration was visible. Stede could see him fighting back tears, his hands shaking as he tried to figure out how to hold himself. It was clear he had so much energy waiting to be burned: his entire frame shook. Stede closed the gap between them, hugging him tight. Ed tried to fight back, pushing and clawing, but Stede held steady. He finally gave in, heavy sobs rattling his chest. They stayed that way forever with Stede\u2019s arms around him and Stede\u2019s voice quietly explaining everything that had happened in the last six months, this story drawn out by the hundreds of \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019s he added.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d Stede said finally.\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Ed agreed.\n\u201cCan we try?\u201d\nHe remained silent, feeling Stede breathe against him. \u201cYeah. I\u2019d like that.\u201d\nFang and Ivan helped to raise the rest of The Revenge\u2019s original crew to the deck. Jim and Frenchie were buried alive beneath the bodies of their crewmates, their laughing protests being drowned out by tearful greetings. Izzy paced up and down the deck, anxiously watching the reunion. He was comforted knowing Blackbeard was back, and Bonnet\u2019s reappearance, however inconvenient, wouldn\u2019t be a distraction. He was devastated, then, to see the two co-captains emerge from the captain\u2019s quarters walking quietly side by side, but with an air of comfort between them. There was a tenseness, but not the one he\u2019d been expecting or hoping. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d Ed addressed the full crew quietly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izzy came forward. \u201cYou\u2019re finally back we-\u201d\nThe taller man turned, his dark eyes hard. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d he repeated. The tone was just as hard as his eyes, his jaw tense. Behind him, the rest of the crew shrank back. Except, of course, Stede, who placed a hand gently on Ed\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNo one\u2019s denying that.\u201d\n\u201cOh, fuck this.\u201d Izzy didn\u2019t carry a gun, he relied exclusively on his sword. Luckily for him, and unfortunately for everyone else, he was especially skilled and lethal enough with only one weapon. Due to this fact, it was a surprise when he reached for Blackbeard\u2019s own gun, plucking it right from its holster on his belt. He cocked it, pointing the barrel directly at Stede. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this again. I won\u2019t.\u201d He knew that he\u2019d have to act immediately, because not only would Ed be able to easily wrestle the weapon from him, he\u2019d also be unable to go through with it if Ed were given the chance to try and talk him down. He loved him, in his own difficult way. It was his job to protect Blackbeard when he couldn\u2019t, or wouldn\u2019t, do it himself.\nA deafening bang. Izzy felt as if he was opening his eyes for the first time during this exchange, and almost vomited at the sight of Stede Bonnet covered in blood, and standing. On the deck of the ship lay Edward Teach, holding his side and panting desperately. Stede dropped to his knees, rolling the man over. Izzy heard him shout orders to the rest of the crew, who nodded and immediately went to work. They respected him, Izzy realized. He also realized that the only thing protecting him at this moment was the simple fact that Stede was preoccupied, frantically bandaging Ed and helping Roach in whatever way was necessary. Izzy stood perfectly still, dumbly watching the scene unfold in front of him. He watched as Oluwande, Fang, Stede, Jim, and Wee John carried Blackbeard with the utmost care, taking centuries just to lift him off the ground so as to not disturb the fresh bandages. The entire crew disappeared into the quarters, their voices frantic and worried but drowned out by Stede\u2019s, which was confidently assuring them he\u2019d be okay. Izzy was left completely alone with the puddle of his captain\u2019s blood, deep red and unforgiving, and the gun still smoking in his hand.\nWhen he finally emerged from the quarters, Izzy saw that his unbuttoned shirt, previously white, was stained red. Blood spatter freckled his bare chest and face. Without a trace of hesitation, he stormed up to Izzy and violently pulled the weapon from his hand, flinging it behind them. There was murder in his eyes. \u201cI want you gone,\u201d he growled. \u201cI want you off my fucking ship.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d\nBy this time, the crew had begun to file out of the quarters, standing behind Stede. They were awaiting orders. In a swift motion he was thrown from the ship, landing in the water beside the small vessel Stede and the majority of the crew arrived on. \u201cI\u2019ll even give you that.\u201d He watched as Izzy clawed his way, soaking wet, onto the little boat. He breathed heavily as he watched Izzy row slowly away, knowing he was still trying to finish the sentence he started before Stede had him thrown from the deck. It didn\u2019t matter now. He turned on his heel, heading straight to where Ed lay. Roach and Wee John sat beside him. He\u2019d be fine, they assured Stede repeatedly.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all be fine,\u201d he replied softly."}, {"blog_name": "cherry-blossom-nats", "id": 683248155797618688, "date": "2022-05-03 16:43:37 GMT", "timestamp": 1651596217, "tags": ["ofmd", "edward teach", "stede bonnet"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZEHy5ebxOfFZmW00", "note_count": 8, "body": "I think Ed and Stede's reunion is going to be rocky and tense but we'll see them progress towards a trusting & sweet state again as Ed slowly grows his beard back out"}, {"blog_name": "dean-coded-ghost", "id": 683486480354656256, "date": "2022-05-06 07:51:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1651823501, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "ed", "stede", "blackbonnet"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZIfTfhbyErKcKa00", "note_count": 37, "body": "So I was rewatching Our Flag Means Death last night and I am going insane.

This will be talked about from a trauma-informed perspective, but I am not a psychologist so take anything I say with a grain of salt. \nThroughout the show, we see Ed represented through several versions of himself, all of which have a different name: Edward, Blackbeard, and The Kraken. All these identities are a part of who he is, they're not performances or something he's forced into doing by others, but serve a purpose to Ed of ensuring his survival. This unconscious splitting of self is a result of sustaining substantial trauma at a young age and acts as a coping mechanism that he carries well into adulthood. \nExtent of Trauma and Impacts Now\nIt probably goes without saying, but Ed got issues. He grew up in an impoverished household where he was exposed to domestic violence at a young age. We only see one scene depicting the violence he was exposed to, but as an audience we can infer that this wasn't the only act of abuse he witnessed his mom suffer. It's also likely, although not canon or confirmed, that Ed was also subjected to some form of abuse as well. With the way he behaves and what we've seen of his childhood, it's more or less definite that Ed has c-PTSD, complex post-traumatic stress disorder. c-PTSD differs from PTSD by being a series of traumatic events sustained over a period of time, and can have more extreme and long-lasting symptoms. \nWe can see the way that this shaped Ed the most clearly in episode 6, where Ed is triggered within the show and experiences a flashback. We get a glimpse into the severity of the impact of his trauma here by a few things. One of the most significant being his memory loss. \nWhen Ed says that The Kraken killed his dad, he wasn't lying. In the moment, that was what he believed, it wasn't him telling stories for a laugh. When children suffer from highly traumatic events, their experiences can be too much for them to handle, and as a form of protection their minds will put up barriers to spare them the pain. This often carries well into adulthood until something comes along to trigger the memories and erodes the barrier. The combination of preparing to kill someone he knew personally, along with being exposed to the imagery of The Kraken, tore down that wall and forced Ed to re-experience his repressed memories. \nAnother indicator to the extent of his trauma is that when he goes into a panic state he hides, and we see that the flashback he's experiencing isn't a single moment, but is ongoing even as Stede talks to him. It's common for flashbacks to distort of the person's reality, where it's not just a memory they're revisiting, but an event that they feel like is happening to them again in detail. Even when Stede knocks on the door and opens it we can see the way Ed flinches, and how this blurs into the moment of his father throwing dishes and striking his mom. There's a blurring of reality occurring here. \nHis trauma leaves him immobilized, hypersensitive, and in a reactive fearful state. Basically, he got issues. Really big issues. \nCompartmentalization of Self\nEd got issues, but also, Ed is an extremely successful and famous pirate. We see him blow up and isolate at times, but we also know that he's renowned worldwide and has the skills to back it. The way he's able to achieve this is through compartmentalizing his trauma and taking on different selves that suit his need. \nThose selves are: Ed, Blackbeard, The Kraken, and although not named in the show as such, his childhood self. \nThe way I like to think about them is through the lens of the Internal Family System, a model of psychotherapy that identifies several parts/sub-personalities as a way of addressing trauma. And I would like to reiterate again, I am not a therapist and I don't have training or anything. This is just how I chose to interpret Ed's character. I'm playing fast and loose with this, and wanna try to not go too far in depth on the specifics. \nAnyways, I' leaning on Bessel van der Kock his book The Body Keeps the Score for how I'm defining terms in this. \nSo, a brief introduction\n\"\nThe core of IFS (Internal Family Systems Therapy) is the notion that the mind of each of us is like a family in which the members have different levels of maturity, excitability, wisdom and pain. The parts form a network or system in which change in any one part will affect all the others. In trauma parts of the self go to war with one another. Self-loathing coexists and fights with grandiosity; loving care with hatred; numbing and passivity with rage and aggression. These extreme parts bear the burden of the trauma. We all have parts that are childlike and fun. When we are abused, these are the parts that are hurt the most, and they become frozen, carrying the pain, terror and betrayal of abuse. This burden makes them toxic \u2013 parts of ourselves that we need to deny at all costs. Because they are locked away inside, IFS calls them the exiles.\nA\nt this point other parts organize to protect the internal family from the exiles. These protectors keep the toxic parts away, but in so doing they take on some of the energy of the abuser. Critical and perfectionistic managers can make sure we never get close to anyone or drive us to be relentlessly productive. Another group of protectors, which IFS calls firefighters, are emergency responders, acting impulsively whenever an experience triggers an exiled emotion.\"\nParts of trauma, abuse, and pain is pushed onto the \"exile\" who carries that burden and is often locked away. Protectors exist to protect those exiles: Managers who handle the day to day life keeping things together often through perfectionism and criticism, and firefighters who respond in emergencies that act out in extreme and often damaging ways. It's all one person, struggling to cope and putting on the necessary hat in the moment to do so. \nVan der Kolk goes on to say:\n\"Each split off part holds different memories, beliefs, and physical sensations; some hold the shame, others the rage, some the pleasure and excitement, another the intense loneliness or the abject compliance. These are all aspects of the abuse experience. The critical insight is that all these parts have a function: to protect the self from feeling the full terror of annihilation.\"\nSeeing the way Blackbeard and The Kraken are treated in the show immediately reminded me of this since they fit so well into a manager and firefighter role, respectively. Ed's clear throughout the show that he is Blackbeard and he is The Kraken. They're not performances, they're a part of himself and they serve a purpose: Protection. \nBlackbeard, the Manager\nThe first iteration of Ed we meet is Blackbeard, the feared infamous pirate captain. As the manager, he's built himself up from poverty and abuse to be in the high place he occupies now. \nBlackbeard is cruel and violent, but he's also calculating and brilliant. He's applies a rigid control to his entire ship, using fear, violence, and manipulation to hold his crew to a set standard, and is even able to offload the worst of his actions onto them while still reaping the benefits of his reputation. \nEd wouldn't have survived this long without Blackbeard. Blackbeard gets shit done. Blackbeard gives him power, he evokes fear and respect. Blackbeard has kept him going for as long as he has. \nEdward, the Child Exile\nOne thing I love and find really interesting about Ed is how when he's triggered or feels emotionally unsafe, he reverts to behavior that's more childish in nature. We see this in a couple of places, whether it's hiding in a bathtub clutching a soft fabric, or fleeing tearfully from mockery at the French dinner. \nThese moments come at high points of emotional insecurity and are ones that are coupled with flashbacks to his childhood trauma, tying it directly to his younger self. It's an incredibly vulnerable place for him to be in, and for the majority of the ones we see on screen, Stede is present to reassure him and let him know he's safe. He defends him from the French captain's insults and does so again when he's hurt at the party. More than that, he's available to offer assurance that this part of him is okay to have. Whether that's telling him he wears fine things well or affirming that he's his friend and agreeing to pretend the whole murder plot never happened. These moments in the end are ones with positive outcomes and healthy developments for Ed. \nThat is, of course, until Stede himself is the cause of triggering his exiles. David Jenkins had said before that Ed hadn't ever been hurt by rejection as badly until then. When he triggers his exile, it's severe. Not just a few minutes of heightened sensitivity and fear, but days long of hurt and hiding. He builds a pillow fort for comfort! Which might seem silly, but is heartbreaking when you consider that survivors of child abuse often will try and physically hide even as adults as a learned behavior. \nAnd this time, Stede isn't there to pick up the pieces. Lucius and the crew try, and to some extent, it does help as they assure him that his feelings are valid and that he will be okay. That, of course, gets majorly fucked up when Izzy intervenes (which I have MANY thoughts on lol) and confirms all of Ed's greatest fears that he is weak, vulnerable, and in danger. Another commonality with survivors of child abuse is viewing your childhood self with contempt, a weaker version who has to be isolated and ignored. Stede spent weeks making Ed think that was untrue, and when he left it showed Ed that he was right to want his childhood self gone. \nIt's only natural for Ed to not want to confront this part of himself. It makes him feel weak and scared, and that's a tragedy in and of itself. \n\"Keeping the exiles locked up stamps out not only memories and emotions but also the parts that hold them \u2013 the parts that were hurt the most by the trauma. Schwartz: \u201cUsually those are your most sensitive, creative, intimacy-loving, lively, playful and innocent parts. By exiling them when they get hurt, they suffer a double whammy \u2013 the insult of your rejection is added to their original injury.\u201d\"\nAnd what happens when Ed is at his lowest, most vulnerable, hurt in a way he hasn't felt in decades? The Kraken comes out. \nThe Kraken, the Firefighter\nOh, babygirl...\nThe most important thing to remember about The Kraken is that he's there to keep Ed safe. He's the last resort, the weapon hidden behind glass to break in case of emergencies. The Kraken isn't there to hurt Ed, he's there to protect him. \nBessel van der Kolk describes it like this:\n\"Firefighters will do anything to make emotional pain go away. Aside from sharing the task of keeping the exiles locked up, they are the opposite of managers. Managers are all about staying in control, while firefightrs will destroy the house in order to extinguish the fire. I\u2019ve met firefighters who shop, drink, play computer games addictively, have impulsive affairs, or exercise compulsively. These can blunt the abused child\u2019s horror and shame, if only for a few hours.\"\nWe first meet The Kraken when Ed is young through the murder of his father. And it's easy to view The Kraken as defined by violence and violence alone, but The Kraken wasn't born to hurt, he came from the desperation of a young boy trying to protect his mother. \nWhen we see The Kraken commit acts of violence, they're not explosive moments fueled by rage, but ones seemingly calculated to achieve the best effect. Lucius, the person other than Stede who saw him at his absolute lowest, was tossed overboard with a smile on Ed's face. I'd argue we can see shades of this in other places too, often it follows moments where we see Edward, the child exile, touched upon. \nEdward screams that he's not a donkey and kicks the captain; The Kraken hands Fang a fork and says to skin him. \nThe Kraken was also something formulated by Ed at a young age, and you can tell with the way he acts. He's cruel and violent, but there's a childishness to it too. He's committing these acts of violence, but at the same playing dress-up because it makes him feel safer this way. He switches between marooning Stede's crew and sobbing at the windowsill alone. \nEd's hurting and The Kraken is willing to sink the entire ship as long as he can make that pain stop. But just like the manager and the exile, this is still a part of him that's just trying to survive. He can't lock away the negative aspects of his person and call it a day, he tried that with Stede, and it ended in disaster. None of these are performances or false selves, they're all him.\nSo, what now?\nIdeally, he'd go to therapy, but I've heard that it may be hard to access in the 1700s or something. \nWhat Ed needs is a safe place, where he can learn how to cope with his feelings without fear of exclusion or hurt. That doesn't mean accepting everything about him no matter what! Stede should probably tell him that it wasn't cool for him to try and murder his whole crew. Still, Ed needs a place where he can feel safe to express himself. \nIt's not just that he feels embarrassed to do so, it's that the totality of his emotions is too much for him to bear. When Ed said he wants to curl up and die, that's not him being dramatic, that's an expression of how hard it is for him to deal with this much emotion at once and the vulnerability that comes with it. \nLike I said, it isn't as simple as deciding that The Kraken and Blackbeard aren't his true selves and that they need to be locked away. They're here for a purpose: to protect Edward. \nAlthough they may not always fulfill that in the most balanced way possible, they still serve a role, and in some ways, there's some gratitude that needs to be expressed to them for keeping Ed alive. Because there's no way that Ed would've survived all these years if it wasn't for them. \nIn a season 2 (dear lord, am I manifesting) I'd really love to see Stede interact with all sides of Ed, especially The Kraken. He might not always make the best choices, but The Kraken is just trying to survive, and I'd love to see him treated softly and with kindness. \nEd is coping with an immeasurable loss, triggered, and scared. Survival and destruction can look shockingly similar when in a state like this, and mistakes are easy to make. Naturally, it doesn't excuse his actions, but it's a very human response based on coping in the only way he knows how.

Yeah. So [Ed] is sitting there, but he's certainly more at ease, you can see that. Because Stede isn't. Stede's realizing that he has possibly screwed everything up and that they're going to die, and I think he's got a lot more going on in his head, and you can see that when they do the kiss. Then Ed walks away, [and] there's just this really puzzled look on Stede's face where he's taking that in, but he's taking so many other things in at the same time, which are: Is this the end? What do I do here? Have I done the right thing? Yeah. But I think I hopefully played that right.\nThis interview with Rhys Darby\u00a0\n\u00a0includes the above bit. They\u2019re talking about the kiss scene on the beach, and Stede\u2019s headspace during it. And while I definitely picked up on him being sorta distracted, and definitely more affected by the being captured bit, I hadn\u2019t realized something. For sure, while for Ed this situation is refreshing because he\u2019s away from the expectations of being Blackbeard, and he\u2019s with the person he loves (though tbh I highly doubt the navy would let them stay together, and wouldn\u2019t that be an interesting little canon divergent story to explore).\nBut for Stede, this is a return to society. Yes, they\u2019d still be at sea, but under the King\u2019s flag, under control by the English Crown, and Stede was trying to escape that same society by becoming a pirate. I mean, there\u2019s a reason he didn\u2019t just join the Navy! He isn\u2019t interested in a machine of state-sanctioned violence, and it doesn\u2019t afford the freedom or adventure he was looking for.\nSo it makes sense that he\u2019d be taking the Act of Grace harder. Yes, it saved their lives, but for how long? How long would they get to stay together? How could they ever be \nTogether\n under the thumb of society? Even if he doesn\u2019t realize that what he\u2019s been feeling towards Ed is romantic love, I\u2019m pretty sure he would know he wouldn\u2019t be able to carry on as he had been, in the navy. His whole life he\u2019s been punished for being himself, and he finally found the freedom to be himself at sea as a pirate. And part of being himself is falling in love with Ed. So now he\u2019s looking down the barrel of a life where he has to pack that all in. And we know from the next and final episode, that when he does try to re-enter society and pack it all in, he\u2019s miserable.\nJust, thinkin about all that."}, {"blog_name": "meattentacle", "id": 683284818137661440, "date": "2022-05-04 02:26:21 GMT", "timestamp": 1651631181, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZLdt1kbxW_m1Wq00", "note_count": 3, "body": "izzy hands belongs in the pear wiggler"}, {"blog_name": "depressedstressedlemonzest", "id": 683063529084977152, "date": "2022-05-01 15:49:04 GMT", "timestamp": 1651420144, "tags": ["ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZvFC1WbwkgaY8e00", "note_count": 4, "body": "Do his eyes glow?\nI bet they will around you Steade."}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683170118519357440, "date": "2022-05-02 20:03:15 GMT", "timestamp": 1651521795, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5Sbx6vfhWW00", "note_count": 1, "body": "Comfort Me With Oranges\nby \nthroughanaquarium\nSet between \"The Art of Fuckery\" and \"This is Happening.\" Ed seems uneasy after Izzy's banishment from the ship, so Stede thinks back to the last time he felt loved and tries to recreate that experience for his co-captain.\n\n\nOr: Justice for Roach's baking skills.\nWords: 4317, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English\nFandoms: \nOur Flag Means Death (TV)\nRating: \nTeen And Up Audiences\nWarnings: \nNo Archive Warnings Apply\nCategories: \nM/M\nCharacters: \nStede Bonnet\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nRoach (Our Flag Means Death)\n, \nLucius Spriggs\nRelationships: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach/Stede Bonnet\nAdditional Tags: \nMissing Scene\n, \nrated for language I guess\n, \nCanon Compliant\n, \nEpisode: s01e06 The Art of Fuckery\n, \nimmoderate use of oranges\n, \nDialogue Heavy\n, \nPOV Stede Bonnet\n, \nStede Bonnet Loves Blackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nAnd He Knows It\n, \nhe just can't use the word\n, \nPining\n, \nPining Stede Bonnet\n, \nMentioned Izzy - Freeform\n, \njustice for Roach's baking skills\n, \ntoo long\n, \nTherapist Lucius Spriggs\n, \nStede's dead mom appears in a memory\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach Deserves Nice Things\n, \n50 orange cake\n, \n40 orange glaze\n, \nSome Humor\n, \nCharacter Study\n, \ndid I remember to say it was too long?\n\nsource \nhttps://archiveofourown.org/works/38750562"}, {"blog_name": "incorrect-life-of-me", "id": 683026430613929984, "date": "2022-05-01 05:59:24 GMT", "timestamp": 1651384764, "tags": ["also jim stan account", "anyways my questionable taste in men continues with this show!!", "hes so hot omg", "ofmd", "our flag means death", "just my ramblings"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZpqHUUbwcEjuya00", "note_count": 5, "body": "the only coherent thoughts i can portray about how i feel about our flag means death is: EDWARD IS SO SEXY OH MY GOD DAY PIRATE MAN I LOVE YOU\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc8b\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc8b\u200d\ud83d\udc68"}, {"blog_name": "trespasssweetlyurged", "id": 683164065281032193, "date": "2022-05-02 18:27:02 GMT", "timestamp": 1651516022, "tags": ["our flag means death", "i just want izzy being competent and violent as a treat", "also i firmly believe that in a sword fight between the two edward would lose", "hand to hand?

It\u2019s basically that you must return to the life you know in order to bury it. While anyone could easily tell you what you left behind is barren, you can only move on to new life once you see the past empty for yourself.\nWe see Stede do this by returning to Mary, only to realize there is nothing left for him there. His family still doesn\u2019t really \nget\n him, and Mary has found someone who makes her happy. He probably knew this all along, but Stede still needed to return to see for real that there wasn\u2019t room for him in that place anymore. And that\u2019s what brings him to the conclusion it\u2019s time to bury that part of his life and walk away. \nWe see this theme with Jim too, when they return to St. Augustine and decide to stay behind to finally get closure with the Siete Gallos. The end of that episode leaves them standing in the empty ruins of their childhood home with their orange tree that no longer bears fruit. It\u2019s a visually and metaphorically barren landscape. This is driven home once Jim finds our more about the Siete Gallos from Spanish Jackie and concludes that revenge isn\u2019t going to fulfill them. It\u2019s certainly closure, but it\u2019s not fulfilling a mission, it\u2019s finding fulfillment aboard the Revenge with Olu.\nAnd finally, we see the same theme with Ed. When Ed returns to the ship after Stede abandons him in the finale, he makes the decision to become Blackbeard again and go back to the well-tread path he found so boring before. \nMaybe this time it\u2019ll be enough\n. But in the final moments, when he\u2019s sobbing alone, we know it\u2019s not. \nHe \nknows it\u2019s not. And Ed is in the moment of realization that the life he had before has nothing more to offer him; hopefully season 2 brings him his closure in the form of fine clothes, seven sugar tea, and Stede\u2019s tenuous smile."}, {"blog_name": "eds-blog-i-guess", "id": 683164608907902976, "date": "2022-05-02 18:35:41 GMT", "timestamp": 1651516541, "tags": ["star trek", "ofmd", "original post"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZlsClSbx5fUT4m00", "note_count": 1, "body": "star trek \ud83e\udd1d ofmd\nsideburns "}, {"blog_name": "thisgirlshouldbestudying", "id": 683509723828502528, "date": "2022-05-06 14:01:08 GMT", "timestamp": 1651845668, "tags": ["Lucius my beloved", "Lucius Spriggs", "Our flag means death", "Ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZJCK5lbyK7ZnKi00", "note_count": 62, "body": "Unbelievable how I went from \"If Jim kills this guy whose name I can't remember I won't even care\" in episode 2 to \"If Lucius is truly dead I'm gonna set fire to the HBO quarters, if it is the last thing I do\" in episode 10.

Will Blackbeard's fury take the best of Ed?\n\n\nThis is post-S1 fix-it fic.\nWords: 3798, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English\nFandoms: \nOur Flag Means Death (TV)\nRating: \nTeen And Up Audiences\nWarnings: \nCreator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings\nCategories: \nM/M\nCharacters: \nStede Bonnet\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nIsrael Hands\n, \nJim Jimenez\n, \nOluwande Boodhari\n, \nFang (Our Flag Means Death)\n, \nIvan (Our Flag Means Death)\n, \nLucius Spriggs\n, \nBlack Pete (Our Flag Means Death)\n, \nFrenchie (Our Flag Means Death)\n, \nWee John Feeney\n, \nCrew of the Revenge (Our Flag Means Death)\nRelationships: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach/Stede Bonnet\n, \nMinor or Background Relationship(s)\nAdditional Tags: \nReunions\n, \nReconciliation\n, \nDrowning\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach Has Feelings\n, \nand he doesn't know how to deal with them\n, \nBlackbeard persona is the only thing that stopps Ed from being drama queen on main\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach invented waterproof makeup\n, \nso he doesn't have to fix it everytime he cries\n, \nHurt Blackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach Needs a Hug\n, \nIdiots in Love\n, \nFix-It\n, \nIzzy Hands is grumpy\n, \nStede Bonnet Being an Idiot\n\nsource \nhttps://archiveofourown.org/works/38772921"}, {"blog_name": "there-is-only-chaos", "id": 683560732851322880, "date": "2022-05-07 03:31:54 GMT", "timestamp": 1651894314, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "I wasn't being sarcastic that's just how I talk"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zd8H0hbyVjre0a00", "note_count": 7, "body": "I absolutely love Lucius' commentary and the  treasure map.

Here's another Izzy Hands post because I literally cannot stop thinking about Izzy and Ed and how their relationship functions.\nSo, we have the greatest pirate in History, Blackbeard, right? This absolutely larger than life, terrifying, powerful, bloodthirsty monster of hate and rage. His legend has made it where literally ships will surrender the \nmoment\n they see his flag. Everyone is so scared of being so thoroughly devastated by him that they would give up and pray for a quick death. But, under all of that, we see Ed. Just Ed. This broken, deeply lost man who is so far gone in self-loathing and depression that he can't find it in him to just... be Ed. He's so \"bored\" (Don't get me started on that word choice in the script. I can spend days on that.) that dying seems like an adventure. He isn't sure who he is or where he stands. He talks about Blackbeard as if he isn't him, as if it is another person. But, ultimately, he can't separate the man from the legend internally either. (See the \"You'd always see me for what I am.\" line in Ep.8)\nThen, you have Israel Hands. Blood, violence, and rage seem to be all he lives for. He's ready to kill for Blackbeard at a moment's notice and would not blink twice. He'd probably die for Blackbeard just as quickly. He is the most devoted worshiper of the god and legend that is Blackbeard. Beneath that? You see an increasingly frustrated and angry person who just wants to protect his friend and doesn't know how to communicate that without lashing out. He tries to support Edward has because that's the only support he is going to get in a world where someone would slit your throat for glory and a few pieces of gold. He's seen all the ugly, squishy underbelly and knows that he needs to be armor to stop someone from killing what is possibly his only real friend.\nThere is a symbiotic yet parasitic relationship between the two. And it's all about Survival. They need each other and they are also going to kill each other.\nWe don't know how long they've been together. But, we know they have been together for a while. Izzy talks about the things he's done in Blackbeard's name \"for years\". I may be assuming here, but I'm sure that the legend reached Izzy before Blackbeard ever did. He has this idea in his head of the man he's sworn to follow and kill and bleed and die for. But, that's Blackbeard, not Ed. He's grown to understand what is beneath the smoke and mirrors. And he \nstill\n stays and prays to the God he's chosen willingly to follow.\nNo one talks about \nwhy\n he stays. No one talks about how we have seen Blackbeard -and even \"Edward\", honestly- manipulate Izzy into staying time and time again, how a few pretty words and side looks is all it takes to make Izzy not climb in the dinghy, how he uses frankly abusive tactics just to keep him from leaving. Whether Edward does this knowing it's actually toxic and abusive or not, we don't know. But, that's what it is. No one talks about how Izzy needs Blackbeard just as much as Edward needs him. This man made a promise to serve Blackbeard to the best of his abilities, no matter what that is or who he has to cut down to protect him. Because he needs him. Whether that's as a purpose for living or self-preservation, I don't know.\nAnd honestly, I think that is why Izzy stays. He cares about Edward, in some sort of messed up way. But that's not who his loyalty is to. He just wants to protect him, even if that means saving him from himself. And what Stede brings out is something soft, something weak, something that will get Edward killed if it shatters the Blackbeard persona entirely. Yes, he does some really manipulative and fucked up things to do that, but so does Blackbeard.  He strings Izzy along with just enough hope and attention, just enough to keep him sated and close at hand. Because he realizes how much he does need Izzy. He needs someone to keep him afloat. And Izzy has been that someone for years. Izzy even says that he has put up with all of the shit because he swore to protect his Captain. Fuck, he sells out Stede with the promise that Edward is free to go, to protect him, when Edward chose Stede over him.\nNow, suddenly, Izzy is no longer the tether Edward is clinging to. And Izzy is just lost. He's been loyal. \nDevoted\n. He's watching his God die. He's watching \nEdward\n die. And he doesn't know how to save him from this. A bullet? A stab wound? Physical trauma that can kill? Yeah. He knows how to deal with that. But all that armor, smoke, and mirrors that is Blackbeard being removed for one man Edward has known for a month? He can't get the attention back on him so he can save this stupid, reckless man from himself.\nYeah, you can take it as jealousy. And you wouldn't be wrong. However, you wouldn't be right either.\nNeither of these broken men would know how to survive without each other. They don't have the skills to save themselves or each other from this deeply toxic spiral made out of a need to survive. They are horrible to each other, but Izzy does try to be patient and good to Edward. And it deeply saddens me that people make Izzy out to be this horrible person who gets off on manipulating Edward."}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683264415622152192, "date": "2022-05-03 21:02:04 GMT", "timestamp": 1651611724, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbxSLsiqi00", "note_count": 0, "body": "Tela\nby \nzekecrist\nStede agarr\u00f3 la tela con una impresionante suavidad y la trat\u00f3 como un objeto profundamente valioso, para proceder a decir algo que se quedar\u00eda grabado en Edward para siempre.\n\u2014Mirate, te quedan bien las telas elegantes.\nWords: 233, Chapters: 1/1, Language: Espa\u00f1ol\nSeries: Part 3 of \nFlowers\nFandoms: \nOur Flag Means Death (TV)\nRating: \nNot Rated\nWarnings: \nCreator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings\nCategories: \nM/M\nCharacters: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nStede Bonnet\nRelationships: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach/Stede Bonnet\nAdditional Tags: \nEpisode: s01e05 The Best Revenge Is Dressing Well\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach Is In Love with Stede Bonnet\n, \nFluff\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach is Bad at Feelings\n\nsource \nhttps://archiveofourown.org/works/38771715"}, {"blog_name": "totallyboatless", "id": 683715015904296960, "date": "2022-05-08 20:24:10 GMT", "timestamp": 1652041450, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "our flag means death meta", "izzy hands"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZJ84CSbz2oywau00", "note_count": 29, "body": "I do think it would be emotionally satisfying for Izzy to have some kind of redemption arc and reach a place of self-acceptance and happiness, but I honestly can\u2019t see him returning to The Revenge.

Someone involved wrote something like (extreme paraphrasing based on my vague memory):\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be happy and have a good life after having fucked up.

Lucius is what Izzy \nwishes\n he was. Confident, proud and most importantly; loved. He has his parade of people around him that love and adore him, and Izzy wants it so bad it pisses him off. He wants that love, but his problem is that he's so wrapped in his own messed up little world that he thinks Blackbeard is the only one that he wants that love from. No matter what way he can get it.\nI want Lucius to survive and \"haunt Ed\", only for the one man with a braincell on the ship to go \"...wait no that's dumb. He's hiding in the walls\". So when he finds Lucius, and Lucius convinces him to let him live (bc he is perfectly capable of doing so) for Lucius to show his gratitude by talking to him and listening to Izzy and his story.\nI'd imagine there to have been a tragic loss in his life (a lover, most likely) and for that death to have messed him up to a point of him building walls around him so he'll never feel that hurt again. Lucius will probably talk about his own past (\n\"i'm fantastic at breakups!\"\n) and then about his relationship with Pete, showing Izzy that love \ncan\n happen again, and will maybe even grow out to be better than before. They would bond, but I don't think there'd be any romance there. Just because they're both gay (yes Izzy is gay, we've all seen it) \ndoesn't mean\n they should bang. I think they'd be great friends, setting their differences aside and just enjoying having someone around that knows the struggle.\nI'd imagine, after Ed finds out Lucius is still alive and Izzy vouches for him, that next time they set port Lucius would help Izzy with speeddating (which is a hilarious concept which I NEED a fanfic of) and Izzy might find someone who has his sense of humor, is tough and looks like he could handle Izzy in a fight. Maybe someone with long hair/a beard (bc maybe Izzy has a type), who knows. And after that goes well, Izzy would thank Lucius by hesitantly letting Lucius hug him (\n\"quickly before i change my mind, you twat!\"\n) and maybe he'd give one of Blackbeard's old rings to him as well, to give to Black Pete once they reunite, which they will and it'll be sappy and cute and etc.\nIdk i think it'd be nice for Izzy to have someone outside of the pirate work. If anything, he needs a breather from it all. Yea he's a tough pirate, but for a 16-year-old things are getting too stressful for him. Give him a cute bartender or smth.

So he'd looked at Stede, and Stede had looked at him, and they'd both sighed and resigned themselves to what had to be done. Izzy was still resigned. Stede, infuriatingly, had gotten over it far too quickly.\n\"...I've known people to be friendly with their bodyguards certainly. Tends to help with the whole protecting-with-one's-life shebang. But it always seemed to be a highly professional relationship at its core. Though I do believe us masquerading as friends would greatly aid us in concealing our true identities, and to assume the roles of entirely different people. Bodyguard. Friend. Hmm. Does your persona enjoy gallivanting?\"\n\"Shut up. We're here.\"\nThe manor sprawled before them in two gluttonous wings, propped up on a white stone foundation dirtied by tracks from the long dirt road through the estate leading up to the house. The wooden exterior was a fashionable mint colour-- paler on the trim-- and nearly buckling under its own excess. A fellow in English Naval dress was positioned at the entrance. Visible weaponry was just the sabre at his hip, though Izzy could tell by his stance that he carried a pistol in his coat as well. The officer's gaze tracked them as they approached.\n\"Good evening!\" Bonnet announced before the man had had a chance to speak. \"A fine day for carousing! I am Sir Thomas Giles and this-,\" he paused, turning to Izzy and patting him on the shoulder. Izzy heard Stede's mistake before the man had even registered he'd said it; \"-is my <i>bodyfriend</i>, Basilica Armitage.\"\nThere was a long pause. The officer looked them up and down. Izzy was going to explode. \"Your boyfriend?\"\u201d"}, {"blog_name": "gossamer-daydream", "id": 683471115274813440, "date": "2022-05-06 03:47:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1651808848, "tags": ["he gets me", "izzy hands", "our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZsmOzhbyBLkmCW00", "note_count": 20, "body": "i kin izzy bc i too am incredibly angry all the time for absolutely no reason"}, {"blog_name": "container-of-apple-juice", "id": 683105679449440256, "date": "2022-05-02 02:59:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1651460341, "tags": ["\u2018you\u2019re the only one to take me up on it!\u2019 about his open library", "I Need To Know", "Lucius", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZnVYAmbwuFy7ei00", "note_count": 4, "body": "What books did Lucius read from Stede\u2019s library ;-;"}, {"blog_name": "itscritiquegeek", "id": 683573435440463872, "date": "2022-05-07 06:53:48 GMT", "timestamp": 1651906428, "tags": ["ofmd", "dracula", "draculadaily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZlVUwRbyYchrKe00", "note_count": 4, "body": "I\u2019ve been back on here for less than three hours and am exclusively getting posts about gay pirates and gay vampires.

He can, and he enjoys it, we\u2019ve seen that. I think what he despises is NEEDLESS violence, or harming innocent lives. \nHis dad with the duck, for example. Stede is shown to be gentle with nature and animals. He didn\u2019t like turtle vs crab. He\u2019s made fun of for picking flowers. This soft side for nature and animals is what makes other people like Nigel and his father think he\u2019s \u201cweak\u201d.\nBut at the same time, he burned a ship down bc there were awful people in it. But at the same time he frowns when calico jack tells him about Ed burning a ship down for fun. Crucially, in Stede\u2019s case, not only were they awful people but he knows the innocent people (the crew and servants) escaped. \nHe pulls a knife on Doug- when he\u2019s drunk and his inhibitions are lowered and also when he feels the need to perform masculinity bc he\u2019s back at home and he can tell it\u2019s not going well. He apologises tho and reconciles with Doug - contrast to when he pulls a knife on Izzy in ep2. Bc again, Izzy was being a dick and stede had no qualms in potentially hurting a man like that. He even says \u201cI rather enjoyed it\u201d. The thing with stede is that he has an internal moral code which is diff from the other \u201cmanly\u201d men he meets, which is why they think he\u2019s weak. \nHe doesn\u2019t flinch when Ed orders a man to be skinned alive bc that man was being racist and a dick. Stede isn\u2019t fully averse to violence & bloodshed. He just doesn\u2019t like seeing innocents harmed. \nThe main conflict between stede and toxic masculinity isn\u2019t violence itself- it\u2019s about \ncaring. \nStede cares about things so much, but the other men he meets don\u2019t. They don\u2019t mind cruel, needless violence, violence as a game, violence for violence\u2019s sake. But the others don\u2019t realise this, and think him completely incapable. And to be fair, he is to an extent, it\u2019s not like he was great with weapons or fighting. But Stede \nhas \nthe\n \ncapacity for violence, as long as it fits within his internal moral code.

One they haven\u2019t used with Oluwande for quite a while now.

With one shoulder damaged, they\u2019ve no choice but to use the other to pour, and that means standing without relying on the table. So they do. And it hurts. It hurts so much that tears spring to their eyes, and their hand shakes as they try to lift the jug. Embarrassing, really. It\u2019s not even that heavy.

They remember the fall, the suffocating waves, the shouting of the crew. They remember blood and water in their eyes. Not being able to tell which way was up. It doesn\u2019t feel so terrifying, down here, with him.\nOluwande fills the glass and puts down the jug. Jim is still clinging tight to him, trembling fingers clenched in his shirt. He too remembers the fear, the clamour, the wind snatching Jim\u2019s name from his lips as the sea swallowed them. He hugs a little tighter. There aren\u2019t many things a pirate doesn\u2019t lose in this life, in his experience.

Izzy revels in violence, in perceived \u201cstrength\u201d, in pain and anger and harm. To be a man, he has to be fearsome, control others or put them down. He despises Stede\u2019s flamboyance, his softness, and of course, is enraged by the effect Stede has on Ed; he can\u2019t fathom the free, comfortable, inherently queer way the crew of the revenge live their lives when he equates all of those behaviours to weakness and, eventually, death. Izzy believes, truly and deeply, that to be violent, to be masculine in this world is to survive, and has convinced himself of this so deeply that there\u2019s no extricating himself from it.\nStede runs away\u2014 away from society and from the role it assigned him. Rather than suffer for the rest of his life being bullied, told he\u2019s weak, he escapes to a solace of his own creation on the sea. And yes, this solace that he runs towards is traditionally a place of toxic masculinity and violence in and of itself (see: Izzy), but Stede takes that and asks \u201cwhy?\u201d. Why live that way when he can make his new home a place where people like him are welcomed and supported? \nEd falls somewhere in between. Like Stede, Ed ran away from the violence of his life to become a pirate, and he was able to build the Blackbeard persona to thrive in that world in a way Stede couldn\u2019t. Like Izzy,  he adopted elements of the traditionally masculine, violent culture in order to survive. He disguises himself as Blackbeard\u2014 ruthless, violent, terrifying\u2014 but thats just it: it\u2019s a disguise, an armour he wears to protect himself from the cruelty and danger of the world. Where Izzy has fully dedicated himself to this way of living, Ed \u2018wears\u2019 the Blackbeard mask when necessary; underneath, he\u2019s still gentle. In fact, throughout the show, he\u2019s seen time and time again trying to escape the persona completely. Izzy has absorbed the culture of violence almost completely; Ed hides behind a mask but still years for softness.\nThe rub, though, is that even though they all reacted differently to the toxic masculinity that was drilled into them from birth, they all inherently internalized it, learning to hate themselves for who they are. All Stede\u2019s life, he was told he was wrong, weak, useless because he was gentle\u2014 in a world where strength and violence were the ideal, he learned that he was a monster for not fitting into that norm. He \u201cdefiles beautiful things\u201d by killing or leaving them, yes, but most painfully, he \u201cdefiles\u201d Ed by making him weak\u2014 by making him more like himself. And that\u2019s why he leaves: because he can\u2019t let himself turn Ed into the same monster he is.\nEd, too, considers himself a monster, not because he\u2019s soft but because he\u2019s a killer. As a child, he did something that fits perfectly with the violent, toxic worldview of the time, and he /hated/ it. His own violence disgusts him, yet it is embodied in the persona he develops\u2014 the persona that he puts on and is put on him, by Izzy and by the rest of the world. He makes himself into a symbol of the violence he hates, convinces himself he IS that masculine ideal\u2014 that that monster is his truest self. He simultaneously uses his masculinity as a shield and pushes it away. \nIf we read Izzy as a queer man with internalized homophobia, who is in love with/worships Blackbeard in his own fucked up way (which is how I imagine Con played him, even if he wasn\u2019t explicitly written that way), we can see how the inherent homophobia of a toxically masculine society affected him too. He hates Ed for wanting to be soft, hates Lucius and Stede and all the others, too, because he craves that softness himself\u2014 has wanted it and denied it for his entire life, because to want those things\u2014 to let himself have them\u2014 would make him weak. He, too, believes the narrative that weakness, kindness, softness, even love make a person Wrong, and he takes his anger out on anyone who hasn\u2019t come to the same conclusion.

Film theory is taught by professors. Even if you weren't taught it academically, you learn it from simply taking in media. You learn this language of cinema and start to recognise tropes and elements. This goes into decisions made in the various levels of the work's production: Screenwriting, art direction, casting, editing, marketing, audio, and so on.\nEditing that lingers on shots of a character looking bittersweetly at another character. Cinematography that makes the decision to add a close-of hands being held together. Lighting that is soft and warm and candle-like. Acting where characters touch another's hand (it is always the hands--even before Pride and Prejudice), only removing the hand when the tension gets to be too much.\nBut Sherlock never goes past the foreshadowing. It is all subtext (or other characters explicitly calling them a couple) without the follow-through. A mystery that is never given the dramatic Hercule Poirot reveal.\nBy season 3 episode 1 of Sherlock, we are given a scene where Moriarty leans in to kiss Sherlock, only for it to be revealed to be an imagine spot. Cementing a sentiment directly into the work itself that Moffat has been alluding to multiple times in interviews: That if you thought John or Moriarty was in love with Sherlock, that you were either stupid or \"completely out of your mind.\"\nThat if you picked up on any clues, you were wrong. That there weren't even \nany\n clues, detective. That heroes can not be LGBT+.\nAnd then the gay pirates arrived, like the hero in a drama that arrives just as you begin to lose hope.\nSo anyway, that's why The Butler Detective has an LGBTQ+ detective duo, and what I mean when I say, \"BBC Sherlock was a big influence on how I wrote this video game.\"\nSometimes, you either have to put on the detective cloak saying, \"You want something done right, you've gotta do it yourself.\"\nOr wait for the gay pirates to arrive."}, {"blog_name": "zombee", "id": 683329720152211456, "date": "2022-05-04 14:20:03 GMT", "timestamp": 1651674003, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "ofmd fic", "blackbonnet", "nandermo", "look i know it makes sense for ed to be nandor", "but guillermo is the competent one so it's not a 1:1", "if you want to read the whole thing so far and let me bounce ideas off you for what the plot could be just let me know"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZMK-ZybxhCAI8y00", "note_count": 21, "body": "Our Flag Means Undeath\nwell, here are the first two chapters of my nandermo blackbonnet crossover fic. i\u2019ve written ten, but i\u2019m not going to start posting them to ao3 until i have a \u201cplot\u201d or whatever. enjoy.\nCHAPTER ONE\nEdward Teach didn\u2019t like working at Panera, but at least it\nwas better than prison.\nHe was, all in all, very good at crime. But he was just\nso-so with pastries.\nGnawing at him, every day, was this aching, yawning, all-consuming\n\nboredom\n. Get up. Pills for the hangover. Pills for the knee. Pills for\nthe fuck of it. Shower. Work. Home. Rum. Sleep.\nHe didn\u2019t have friends. He couldn\u2019t drum up the interest for\nnew lovers. He still saw the boys, sometimes, Izzy and all them \u2013 but it was\nless and less, when he kept refusing to join them on jobs. He missed the life,\nhe guessed, but he was never, ever going back to fucking prison. He\u2019d rather\ndie assembling you-pick-twos.\nA shell of who he once was, was Edward Teach. And bored, so bored.\nBored and stuck and yearning for something new.\nSomething like a head of golden curls and the most ridiculous\noutfit he had ever seen on a human being waltzing into the store thirty minutes\nbefore close. Frills and buttons and lace that did not\n \nbelong in this\ncentury, much less a Panera Bread. Besides the gleaming watch, Ed placed the\nwhole thing at mid-18\nth\n century, before he remembered he was too stupid\nand too rough to know something like that.\nSaid man walked up to the register and smiled at Ed like he\nhadn\u2019t been smiled at in a good long while. Even without his reputation, the\nhair and the beard and the scowl usually kept most people at bay.\n\u201cHello!\u201d\n\u201cHi. What can I get you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not here for human food.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s words were as perplexing as his clothes.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m here because I had an interview, with someone named\nPete?\u201d\nEd blinked.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know his last name, er\u2014\u201d\nHis eyes darted to Ed\u2019s name tag. \n\u201cEdward,\u201d he finished.\n\u201cEd\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cRighto! Nice to meet you, Ed. I\u2019m Stede.\u201d\nStede smiled again, and Ed, before he could stop himself,\nsmiled back. \nThe moment seemed to linger. \nSomething inside Ed \nlurched\n.\nPete\u2019s voice broke the tension. \u201cMr. the Gentleman, sir!\u201d\nStill smiling, Stede nodded once at Ed, before turning his attention\nto Pete.\n\u201cAre you ready for the interview, my dear boy?\u201d\nPete nodded, before he said to Ed, \u201cYou\u2019ll cover me \u2018til\nclose?\u201d\nEd looked around the very empty Panera. \u201cSure.\u201d\nEd put the fancy man out of his mind. He would never see him\nagain.\nCHAPTER TWO\nIt was forty-five minutes later when he saw him again.\nEd finished his smoke and went to heave the bag of trash\ninto the dumpster. He heard a muffled \u201c\nfuck!\u201d \nand then Stede seemed to\nrise out of the dumpster as if he could fly.\nWhich wasn\u2019t the most bizarre thing that was happening, as\nhe also appeared to be steaming.\n\u201cWas that garlic!\u201d he said.\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Ed sniffed, and got a noseful of garbage for his\ntrouble. \u201cYeah, maybe. I dunno. Garlic bread probably.\u201d\nStede looked very put out. Ed\u2019s thoughts tried to skitter around\nthe word cute before giving up and accepting it.\n\u201cI know it heals quick, but oh, it stings!\u201d\nEd leaned against the dumpster in a very cool way. At least\nthings made sense now. \u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire.\u201d\n\u201cNo, actually, I\u2019m a vamp\u2014\u201d Stede frowned. \u201cHow could you possibly\nknow that?\u201d\nEd shrugged. \u201cRan with a few of them in my day. Weird\nfuckers. No offense.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d\nThey eyed each other.\n\u201cI was actually going to, well. I was going to eat you.\u201d\nEd barked out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m no virgin, Stede the Gentleman.\u201d\nThere he went smiling again. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of me?\u201d\n\u201cI heard Pete say it.\u201d\nThe smile was gone, and Ed did not like that one bit.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re very, uh. I like your clothes.\u201d\n\u201cDo you!\u201d Stede preened and posed.\n\u201cWhat is that, silk?\u201d\nStede nodded and fiddled with his lapel. \u201cA rather exquisite\nduchesse satin.\u201d \n\u201cMust be a bitch to get blood out of.\u201d\nThen Stede giggled.\nAnd Ed was \nfucked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny you should say that,\u201d Stede said. \u201cTell me, Ed, are\nyou happy at Panera?\u201d\nEd shrugged. Stede leaned toward him.\n\u201cDo you know what a familiar is?\u201d\nEd did know. But he wanted to hear Stede talk some more, so\nhe shook his head.\n\u201cA vampire\u2019s familiar is like their personal assistant. Chores\nand such. Sourcing food. Cleaning up after.\u201d\n\u201cAfter what?\u201d\nVampires could not flush, but Stede was doing his damndest\nto try. He gestured and opened his mouth as if to speak, thought better of it,\nthen waved his hand back and forth. He opened his mouth again, closed it, opened\nit, then said, \u201cOh, you know.\u201d\nStede\u2019s swishing sleeves left white streaks in Ed\u2019s vision.\n\u201cBlood. Semen. Vampire things,\u201d Ed said.\nStede looked grateful. \u201cYes! Yes. See, you already know so\nmuch. You\u2019d probably make an excellent familiar.

Ed is a member of a rock band with Izzy, Ivan, and Fang that\u2019s gaining popularity, he also lives in these apartments and is usually practicing with them in the afternoons. Because Ed\u2019s apartment isn\u2019t super far above the shop they can usually hear the band playing and this wasn\u2019t a problem until it just kept getting louder and the lyrics were getting more vulgar. So Stede storms up and when Ed opens the door he\u2019s greeted with this man in gardening gloves rambling about keeping the noise down during business hours and how they need to be more considerate before storming away. Ed is immediately smitten, he goes down to apologize soon after. Slow-burn friends to lovers where there\u2019s loads of mutual pining but Stede is a little dense and doesn\u2019t realize Ed likes him back until they\u2019re literally kissing.\nStede:\n- Used to work for his family\u2019s Law Firm and absolutely hated it.\n- Mary and the kids! They all still get along, in this AU Stede didn\u2019t leave in the night, he came to terms with who he was at the ripe age of 38 and they got a divorce-- this fic is set four years after this. Stede likes Doug, sometimes he and Mary argue about parenting choices but overall are good, Stede has yet to be in a relationship.\n- Stede named his flower shop The Revenge as an act of defiance against his father, who constantly tells Stede he\u2019s a disappointment and will eventually come crawling back to him-- Stede has a knack for flower hybrids so yeah, no, not happening. He\u2019s one of the most successful florists in town (not that there are many) and is doing very well for himself!\n- Speaking of his shop, he works with Lucius, Pete, Olu, Jim, and Frenchie. Wee John, Roach, Buttons, and the Swede are good friends of theirs and they all often have movie nights in the back room of the shop. it\u2019s a little cramped, but they all love it.\nEd:\u00a0\n- Used to party way too much in college and has been a member of many bands. The one he\u2019s in now seems to be going somewhere though, Ed is an amazing guitarist. He offers to teach Stede how to play but it\u2019s mostly an excuse to put his hands over Stede\u2019s to show him how his fingers should be on the frets.\n- Definitely a sap but doesn\u2019t show it much around other people. When he likes someone it\u2019s painfully obvious though, and Izzy is furious when he realizes his dumbass band leader is in love with someone like Stede.\n- Asks Stede to teach him about flowers-- He\u2019s really good at arranging bouquets but keeps using flowers with really passive aggressive meanings behind them (\u201dEd, this looks lovely, but these flowers are essentially telling whoever you\u2019re giving this to to die in a hole.\u201d\u00a0\u201c??? Flowers can talk???\u201d). At one point Stede puts some flowers in his hair end Ed about dies.\u00a0\n- Ed learns Stede\u2019s favorite flower is Edelweiss and gets a tattoo of some on his hip. He doesn\u2019t tell Stede where it is (or that he got it because of Stede), just tells him that he got a flower tattoo because he realized that he liked flowers a lot. Stede eventually gets to see it in person and melts.\nI have yet to come up with a name for the fic (ideas welcome, I\u2019d be sure to credit you!) but if y\u2019all want I can share a link when I start posting it on Ao3! I\u2019ll also be doing some art for this AU and if anyone makes any I\u2019d love to see it! :)"}, {"blog_name": "sacchairnebeat", "id": 683405678107377664, "date": "2022-05-05 10:27:22 GMT", "timestamp": 1651746442, "tags": ["our flag means death", "hehe", "stede bonnet", "ofmd", "blackbeard"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZgA96YbxyTVf4q00", "note_count": 0, "body": "It\u2019s so funny when people draw Stede so young like he\u2019s reaching 40 \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d"}, {"blog_name": "necromcom", "id": 683742336919994368, "date": "2022-05-09 03:38:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1652067505, "tags": ["ofmd", "dot txt", "izzy hands"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z_fxGUbz90Xc0m00", "note_count": 20, "body": "im all on board the \"ofmd needs a musical episode\" train and also inside the \"izzy needs to sing in it\" car of the aforementioned train but im sitting in the very specific seat labeled \"izzy's song is just a couple of delicate, maudlin little lines that then get interrupted unceremoniously a la dawn's lament in the buffy musical\""}, {"blog_name": "smute", "id": 683058896223551488, "date": "2022-05-01 14:35:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1651415725, "tags": ["now that's a fuckery", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zsnilsbwjd9s4q00", "note_count": 4, "body": "oh my god that last ep was insane fkfjskkejfjdkw"}, {"blog_name": "ameizingme", "id": 683051537784799232, "date": "2022-05-01 12:38:28 GMT", "timestamp": 1651408708, "tags": ["meiment", "ofmd", "heartstopper tv", "heartstopper show", "heartstopper", "arcane", "shitpost"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZYWXFYbwhy4mye00", "note_count": 17, "body": "gonna start blaming all of my troubles on the media i consume. heartstopper's rain kiss is the reason for my acid reflux. i have extensor tendonitis and i can't walk and it's all ofmd's fault. my allergy flare-ups are because of arcane"}, {"blog_name": "napoleanbonafarte", "id": 683356689478631424, "date": "2022-05-04 21:28:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1651699723, "tags": ["ofmd", "i don't even watch but it's all over my dash and that's what goes through my head every time i see it", "m"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZWc2lqbxnKdRGi00", "note_count": 5, "body": "oh my fucking dod "}, {"blog_name": "mike-wheelah", "id": 683298014667898880, "date": "2022-05-04 05:56:07 GMT", "timestamp": 1651643767, "tags": ["FUCK they were in LOVE", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z4xWNUbxZ_oG0e00", "note_count": 5, "body": "guess who cried about pirates today"}, {"blog_name": "cheers-mdears", "id": 683607844298407936, "date": "2022-05-07 16:00:43 GMT", "timestamp": 1651939243, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "ofmd meta", "character analysis", "ofmd edward teach", "indrid talks"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZBU92SbygRPb4y00", "note_count": 109, "body": "Was thinking about how Ed's lyrics included \"nothing makes sense now\" and it occurred to me that he left with Jack because he thought Stede only liked him as Ed and not as Blackbeard.

I have a few more ideas floating around in this\u00a0\u2018verse, hmu if you want to hear them <3\u00a0\nRead on AO3 (600wd)\nRetirement\nEd\u2019s Bar and Grill turns out to be a success.\nIt\u2019s not exactly a roaring one\u2026 more an eking one. But the locals like it. And more importantly, Edward himself rather likes it too. It\u2019s got a seafaring vibe - they couldn\u2019t leave it completely behind of course - with trinkets and equipment and even driftwood from the old girl Revenge to keep them company. It\u2019s got most of the loyal crew floating around them too; Lucius has stayed on as a waiter (though he prefers maitre-d) , for example, and Olu and Jim run a farm on a bit of land nearby and bring them regular shipments of produce.\nThere\u2019s a lot of fruit - as many oranges and lemons as they could dream, as well as apples and pears. And goats. And from the goats, he gets plenty of that lavender soap he so loves. Stede makes it for him by hand. He\u2019s offered a number of times to show Edward how to make it, but if he\u2019s honest, Edward enjoys the little gift. As promised, Stede gets excited about a little gift too. In fact they have a corner of the restaurant dedicated to it, and they sell other stitched and whittled works from the crew as well.\nEdward, well, he prefers to stick himself behind the very grill for which his establishment - even if that is a bit of a strong word - is named. From here he can watch the whole place play out, just about. He can chat with the patrons. He can hear Frenchie spin ditties and ballads and bawds, or watch Stede perform tales of glory and roguishness, an entertaining melodrama blending fiction teasingly with fact.\nHe\u2019s even come around to the idea of pets. Whether that be Olivia and her youngins hanging around making a nuisance of themselves, or the jowly face of a mastiff named Polly - Fang and Ivan\u2019s latest addition, sitting at her masters\u2019 feet or chasing a turnip of all bloody things through poor Olivia\u2019s family reunion. The animals are personalities, he has to admit it, and sometimes they even bring a smile to his face. They remind him that he doesn\u2019t need to be bound by Blackbeard, by the Kraken, by the harm he did and had done to him back then. He can have a loving life. A happy life. A peaceful life.\n\u201cEd?\u201d\nStede\u2019s voice prods him gently from his rumination. He shakes it off, and smiles. Stede smiles too. His hair isn\u2019t as lustrous and golden as it once was, but it shines in the light of the setting sun as he puts an arm around Edward, and kisses him briefly on his way past. Edward\u2019s stomach growls; he can taste something amazing on Stede\u2019s lips, and he\u2019s not just saying that to be cute.\nIn answer to the question he didn\u2019t ask, Stede holds up a small, delicate dessert bowl of something even more golden and delicious.\u00a0\n\u201cRoach made peach cobbler,\u201d Stede explains. \u201cFresh from the oven. I couldn\u2019t help sneaking a bite.\u201d\n\u201cI bloody love you,\u201d Edward swears. He eyes the proffered bowl and spoon with a ravenous sparkle, and Stede is only too happy to oblige, taking spoonful after spoonful of the sweet treat and sharing it out between the two of them.\nIt\u2019s warm and rich and delicious, and it\u2019s a feeling that stays with Edward long after the cobbler itself is finished and the dinner rush is on. The place gets louder; he\u2019s back to slinging sausages and stuffed mushrooms; Stede launches the evening\u2019s installment of Peter Pan, voices and all. There\u2019s a clamour of sound all around him.\nBut Edward is at peace."}, {"blog_name": "deavocado", "id": 683312436701528064, "date": "2022-05-04 09:45:20 GMT", "timestamp": 1651657520, "tags": ["the gentleman pirate strikes by gay ghosting", "because he thinks Ed is dead", "he thinks he's the kraken now poor baby", "our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZqF2qxbxdGfqCu00", "note_count": 29, "body": "Oh my God I just realised\nEd thinks Stede killed him with kindness "}, {"blog_name": "snitling", "id": 683793299469959168, "date": "2022-05-09 17:08:27 GMT", "timestamp": 1652116107, "tags": ["omfd", "izzy hands", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zy0-WsbzKc8Aim00", "note_count": 18, "body": "I think of it like this: I know Stede and Ed are in love and David Jenkins wouldn't betray me by splitting them up permanently or killing one of them.

And honestly, I'm a little angry about this. Like there's gotta be someone out there.\nHonestly, it's probably more of a feeling, a wish, and projecting than anything else. But the fact that he was kissed and then took days to realize he deeply loved the man who kissed him screams ace to me because it's weird when you understand what love is from other people's perspectives, but it just does not line up with what you feel.\nTrue, he's probably never seen love before so doesn't know what to expect. But allos feel attraction, and that falls into a social standard that people expect (even in the 1700s. Or the weird 1700s ofmd is based in lol), and allows them to better understand these feelings. It's only when someone explains what love is outside of social standards of sex, a human connection of understanding someone and romantically loving them, but not necessarily having sex with them, that he begins to understand his feelings, that this is love and it doesn't have to involve sex. It's not what everyone told him was love, but it's his love, and it's real and true and worth fighting for.\nAnd sure, this could just be loving a man, but I mean, he's seen that before and (from what I understand) he would feel it physically more, which could lead him to understand his love easier because that's what he's been told is love. Plus, as I've seen many people say, he never panics or questions that two men can and do love each other. His question is if someone can love him, and when your ace and it's been drilled in your head that no one will ever care about you romantically, it really doesn't seem possible if someone does, especially if they're not ace. \nNot to mention, he seems pretty indifferent to sex throughout the series. When Calico Jack talks about it, he seems curious but not desiring. I could easily see that scene as anger from not fitting into this idea of needing to have sex to love someone than only jealousy. I mean, he very clearly feels totally out of place, a feeling I certainly feel when someone talks about how essential sex is for love, and why haven't you done that?\nI think ace people come to terms differently with love because we're taught sex and sexual attraction is so essential to it. And the series feels a lot like Stede coming to terms with loving someone outside of sexual desires and attraction and how beautiful and fitting that is to who he is. No one else feels this way to me. It's specifically Stede's character.\nAnd I am pretty sure this would never be where the story is heading because sex is soooo enticing and interesting and funny for allos, and I have no faith in anything having ace characters. But, a lot of people also did not have faith that there would be so much queerness in ofmd, so maybe it could happen. \nif \nwhen it does get renewed, they have to have an ace character, even if it's not Stede (but i would love that)"}, {"blog_name": "thinkhappythxughts", "id": 683539367574306816, "date": "2022-05-06 21:52:19 GMT", "timestamp": 1651873939, "tags": ["me", "ofmd", "our flag means death", "i mean the entire soundtrack deserves a few listens but this took me out", "i wish they released an album with all their variations on gnossiene and including the chain and stuff"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zx9TktbyQsxgGm00", "note_count": 12, "body": "i am begging everyone to listen to listen to\u00a0\u201cHus-band\u201d from the ofmd soundtrack.

And snippets of fanfic I haven\u2019t written creep in, so this is going to be a wild mash-up. For your sake under the cut. It features in non-chronological order: Izzy\u2019s and Ed\u2019s co-dependent dysfunctional relationship, Izzy at the brink of death, gardening, Izzy at a stitch-and-bitch with Mary Bonnet, personal growth and Steven Universe fusions (not really, altough....)\nsorry for the braindump. \nTo set the scene: Stede has caught up to Ed but before anything meaningful beyond a glance can happen, they are being attacked. It\u2019s chaos. In the firefight, the enemy shoots at Ed, but Izzy pushes him out of the way, ending up wounded himself. It\u2019s chaos after that, too, with Ed being extra violent and Stede a little bit frightened of this side he hasn\u2019t seen before. \nEd pokes Izzy with his foot to get up, maybe telling him that\u2019s no time to laze about. But Izzy doesn\u2019t get up. There\u2019s a substantial pool of blood surrounding him, it\u2019s bad. Yet he still manages to ask Ed if he\u2019s safe. \nIzzy fades in and out of consciousness, finally comes to for more than a few seconds in bed, overhearing a hushed conversation about shellshocked Ed and voice-of-reason-Stede. It boils down to the fact that Izzy can\u2019t be cared for on board of the ship, he needs proper medical attention, rest and stability. Since they\u2019re not far from his home, Stede proposes to take Izzy to a local doctor. \nIzzy makes it known that he\u2019s awake by coughing up blood or some equally charming. Ed rushes to his side, hovering. Izzy is resigned and hurt (in more ways than one) and takes it out on Ed. Saying how he\u2019s pushed aside for someone better, that Ed is abandoning him after everything that Izzy has done for him. Izzy tells him that for years he has done everything to keep Ed safe, he ran his ship, covered for him, carried out his orders, maintained Blackbeard\u2019s reputation, all to keep Ed safe, to keep him alive, only to be cast aside when he\u2019s not useful anymore. Ed wants to counter that that\u2019s not what he wanted, that Izzy trapped him in that reputation, but is interrupted by more coughing or Izzy bleeding through his bandages. As he tries to fix it or help him up, he realizes that it\u2019s been years since he had a honest-to-god conversation, talked about anything meaningful or asked anything personal about Izzy. Izzy does not want to go, tells Ed he knew he\u2019d give his life for Ed (after all, he\u2019s had a lot of practice). And probably cusses out Stede for tainting Ed with softness, for making him unsafe, almost getting him killed. \nBut Izzy is in bad shape (and the plot demands thusly) and Stede (in either a wig and/or fake moustache and a fake unbelievable accent) accompanies Izzy to the doctor. As for recuperation.....well, he asks Mary. \nMary is less than enthusiastic but goes along with it and agrees to house Izzy until he\u2019s recovered. Stede and Ed go back to the ship, Izzy stays behind. He is less angry than resigned after being replaced. He gets along surprisingly well with Mary. He doesn\u2019t curse too much (he doesn\u2019t need to give any orders or defend Blackbeard or bear the responsibility of both first mate and captain at the same time) and he feels a kinship (at first it\u2019s misguided) with her, both effectiely spouses left behind for a shiny new plaything, regardless of their sacrifice. \nMary warms up to him and when he is well enough, includes him in a few of her activities. It\u2019s not improper (to the society) since he\u2019s obviously a widower still in mourning, as is she (somewhat). Something in Izzy wants to rebel at the thought of luxury but he has a (the first of several) revelation: he doesn\u2019t dislike soft things or luxury per se. He only did when he had too much weight on his shoulders, when he was so focused on survival that he couldn\u2019t contemplate any unnecessary expense. And Mary doesn\u2019t need protection in the form of a ruthless reputation, she does quite well on her own. (I love the mental image of inviting Izzy to a stitch\u2019n\u2019bitch with lots of gossiping ladies who adore him for his gives-no-fucks-attitude. And that he can sew reasonably well). Izzy does a bit of healing (in more ways than one). Also the kids think he\u2019s scary at first, but quickly grow to love Uncle Izzy who teaces them cuss words and goes along with their fanciful ideas because they\u2019re kids and should be indulged and he can afford it and he doesn\u2019t need to be who he was to keep them safe. Izzy grows more carefree since he has no responsibilities but to himself and everything is well. \nUntil Ed and Stede come back to check on him. Stede is put off that Mary and the kids get along so well with Izzy and that makes Izzy glad in a very petty way. (mental image of somehting like a kite stuck in a tree and Izzy smugly climbing up to get it after seeing Stede failing at retrieving it). Then it\u2019s time for the heart to heart with Ed. \nBoth apologize. Izzy explains that he\u2019s had a lot of time to think and the problem with Blackbeard wasn\u2019t that it was a facade or bad for Ed or dragged on for too long - it was all of that and it was bad for Izzy, too. \nBlackbeard wasn\u2019t you. \nBlackbeard was \nus\n.\n \nEd and Izzy created Blackbeard together, for safety, for protection and it worked too well, until they didn\u2019t know how to stop. Ed checked out and left Izzy to cover for him and Izzy poured everything he had into the role. He worked tirelessly to take over Ed\u2019s tasks while fulfilling his original role; he became a mean angry bastard because he had to be; he became the manager from hell because he believed that anything less would jeopardize their (mainly Ed\u2019s) safety. He didn\u2019t know how to stop. He wasn\u2019t a fan of Ed\u2019s initial idea of retirement, but saw it as a way out that would keep Ed safe, getting rid of Blackbeard. But he went along until he saw that Ed wasn\u2019t sticking to it anymore; that his worst fears had become true. Ed showed softness and in Izzy\u2019s mind alarm sirens blared (anachronistically) that Ed was in danger and that Izzy had to, yet again, step up and take over. \n(I had that thought like a week ago after I thought about a Steven Universe AU and just when I asked myself if a fusion between Ed and Izzy would be stable or instable, I realized that they already had one - Blackbeard). \nIzzy apologizes that he lost sight of what mattered - Ed - and hurt him in the process, stifling Ed, when what he wanted was the opposite. \nEd apologizes, too. For taking Izzy granted, for using him as a crutch so long he\u2019d stopped thinking of him as his friend, as a person, only as his function. For piling more and more work on him, using Izzy for everything until Izzy had no life, too. Until they both were nothing more than shadow puppets, acting out the same thing over and over again because he couldn\u2019t just talk to Izzy like a normal person. For not seeing Izzy - brave, loyal Izzy who protected him for years until Blackbeard had become a cage for them both.\u00a0\nEd takes in this Izzy - collar undone, pants rolled up, naked feet in the sand (guilt for his cruelty), yet still marked by him with (if canonical his name on his face, or at least by) the bandage around his torso, another sign of how much of himself Izzy had given for Ed. \nEd cradles his face, thumb stroking over the tattoo, the mirror of what Izzy had done.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in love with me, Izzy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cHave been for the past 20 years, but thank you for noticing.\u201d\nThen it\u2019s a bit awkward because Ed does not have romantic love for Izzy but love nontheless. \nThey decide to bury Blackbeard on the beach. \nIzzy takes off the ring around his neckerchief.\n\u201cBlackbeard, I let you go.\u201d\nIt\u2019s awkward still.\nWhat are you going to do now? Ed asks, because he wants Izzy\u2019s honest opinion and not to hear the answer Izzy thinks Ed wants to hear (because that has been the right answer). \nI\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know who I am without Blackbeard.\nBecause Izzy has defined himself as part of him for years, eroded his will bit by bit. \nI\u2019m not Blackbeard\u2019s first mate. I am nothing. I\u2018m empty. \nYou\u2019re my-.... you\u2019re Izzy. You\u2019re my best friend. I would love to have you onboard. And yet I understand if you don\u2019t....if you need space. \nBecause this distance from one another has been one of the best things that has happened in years, brought them so much growth and clarity. \nI think....I want to be happy. \nI want you to be happy, too, Iz. \nHow does one get to be happy? \nYou do things you like, I suppose. Spend time with people you like. And don\u2019t care what others think of you. \nLike you and Stede? \nFaintly blushing, Yes. He makes me happy. \nThe jealousy does sting like a gunshot wound (and Izzy can compare). \nIzzy decides to come along to \u201cbe a useless fucker\u201d. Because their ship is filled with them but they\u2019re happy so he wants a turn at being useless. \nSo he rejoins the ship, but not as first mate (Olu gets a promotion?), he\u2019s finally free of responsibilities. \nThere\u2019s a readjustment period where he instinctively wants to yell, tell people what to do, but he stops himself. The crew is weirded out at first, but the co-captains seem happy and Izzy not insulting them feels good. Plus, they realize why he\u2019s been hounding them for maintenance and work when the ship almost falls apart a few days in because Izzy has stopped working overtime and they need to step up. \nHe tries a bit of everything (cooking, sewing, singing, crude pictures) but doesn\u2019t find what is right for him. At one point they get news from Mary and the kids (mail? can pirates get mail?), Mary sends him a letter and the kids have enclosed things, among them pressed flowers and a few seeds and Izzy wonders aloud if one can have a garden on a ship. Ed and Stede are delighted and together they try to find out.

And clearly I'm not going to fall asleep until I write it all down.\nStede knew he was attracted to Ed on Day 1, had developed a full blown inappropriate crush by the fancy French party, and knew he loved him in the English penitentiary. Remember, when he goes home, he's the one who asks Mary unprompted about what being in love feels like - he knows it but he wants outside confirmation. So why doesn't he act?\n1a) Stede was bullied as a child for being soft and effeminate, and it's explicitly clear that the memories of bullying affect his choices as an adult. He's scared shitless that Ed would not only reject him, but would also bully him.\n1b) He's also afraid that acting on attraction to a man would prove his childhood bullies right, due to internalized homophobia.\n2) He's also afraid that a relationship with Ed will ruin Blackbeard, a fear that Izzy Hands makes every effort to confirm.\n3) He doesn't want to break his marriage vows, because on some level he believes he'll have to go home eventually.\nNow, 1a is resolved when Ed makes a move, he's making progress on 1b as he gains confidence and starts to believe he can be kind and gentle without being weak, and when Mary gives her blessing in the final episode we know point 3 will no longer be an issue. #2 is still going to be a problem, and I hope in Season 2 when he sees that being Blackbeard is making Ed miserable, that will help him get past it.\nNow, Ed: Ed was fascinated by Stede on Day 1, his crush started with a bang during the French Party, and he realizes he's in love when Stede and Izzy duel and he believes that he's about to lose Stede. So what takes him so long to make a move?\nI think we all know Ed is terrified of rejection - not just for himself, but also for his image. If he makes a move and Stede shoots him down, he is going to be a laughingstock.\nHe doesn't know how to read Stede yet. He can't tell if he's flirting or if he's just Like That as a gentleman. Honestly, Stede can't tell either, so no wonder Ed is confused!\nIzzy is messing with his head. Thanks a lot, Izzy.\nHe's afraid that Stede doesn't truly know him, and once he realizes that he's not just Ed, he also really is Blackbeard, that Stede will not want him anymore. He confirmed this explicitly in the Calico Jack episode.\nHe's been steeped in pirate culture for decades, and some of the things we've seen about pirate culture: friendship and romance are off the table, weak men deserve to be punished, your first loyalty is to yourself and nobody else, and putting trust in somebody is just asking for them to fuck you over in the end.\nEd is going to need more time than Stede to figure his shit out in Season 2. He knows what he wants, but he isn't convinced yet that he's allowed to have it."}, {"blog_name": "clearlyaginger", "id": 683720780080644096, "date": "2022-05-08 21:55:47 GMT", "timestamp": 1652046947, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "blackbeard", "edward teach", "stede bonnet", "lucius", "i dont know his last name if he has one", "my guY"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZbX-Yqbz46rEGe00", "note_count": 12, "body": "I think Lucius climbed back on board the ship and next season either Jim's gonna find him hiding in idk the potatoes or something and they'll be like \"wtf are you doing here???\" And of course they'll keep his secret\nOR.\nOr, and this will wrench my heart \u2764\ufe0f\nEd will find him and be conflicted abt killing him/telling Izzy but eventually he'll just sit and talk and Lucius will help him put Blackbeard away and when Stede catches up Ed will have a moment where he's nervous but looks back and Lucius nods like \"go on\" and then Ed tells Stede how he broke his heart and blah blah blah it all turns out okay and they get back together and if it doesn't work out I will Cry"}, {"blog_name": "fishingscam", "id": 683165169780686848, "date": "2022-05-02 18:44:36 GMT", "timestamp": 1651517076, "tags": ["i am shoving them together like dolls", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z3wErebx5nepie00", "note_count": 0, "body": "s2 wishes include stede whispering \u201ci\u2019m sorry\u201d before stede and ed kiss"}, {"blog_name": "sokkatheartist", "id": 683062429419225089, "date": "2022-05-01 15:31:35 GMT", "timestamp": 1651419095, "tags": ["ofmd", "gray speaks"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Zit4DTbwkQaOyi01", "note_count": 5, "body": "So it sounds like all the fans want is for Ed & Stede to reunite, for Lucias to be alive, and for a cat to imprint on Frenchie, yes?"}, {"blog_name": "elliotjonesss", "id": 683770281463037952, "date": "2022-05-09 11:02:35 GMT", "timestamp": 1652094155, "tags": ["steddyhands", "ofmd", "our flag means death"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z3uRmmbzFNA_ai00", "note_count": 13, "body": "being a steddyhands enjoyer is like gee stede how come your wife lets you have TWO boyfriends and anyway it's exemplary and delicious"}, {"blog_name": "stede-blackbeard", "id": 683638072048566272, "date": "2022-05-08 00:01:11 GMT", "timestamp": 1651968071, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "my post"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZpbK5SbynJHNOq00", "note_count": 3, "body": "I love fang and frenchie so much.

Shooting.\n\u201cI think I might be hopeless,\u201d Stede whined.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ed told him. \u201cYou just need a little practice. That\u2019s all.

Stede scowled and he grinned wider. \u201cHere. Let me just \u2014\u201c\nAnd then hands were on his waist, applying the slightest pressure and he was turning. A boot pressed against the inside of his foot, a knee knocked his as it instructed him to move. Ed's hand slid down his arm, over the fabric of his shirt, until fingers traced over the skin of his wrist. Then the hand wrapped around his own, hot and callused and gentle. A chin rested on his shoulder. He could feel a beard tickle his cheek.\nStede had never been more aware of his own body. Everywhere Ed pressed against him felt like pins and needles had erupted. A heat was filling him and making him rather faint. The sun. It was. Something.\nEd was talking. Stede hadn\u2019t been listening. How rude.\n\u201cYou gotta relax,\u201d Ed said. That was absolutely not in the cards right now. \u201cAnd then you just.\u201d Stede wasn\u2019t even looking at the target. Instead turned his head slightly to look into the brightest eyes he\u2019d ever seen, narrowed, focused and aiming into the distance. Ed released a slow breath and Stede felt it ghost hot across his mouth. Something warm and liquid unspooled in his gut. He felt \nhungry\n.\nThe bang of the gun had him stepping back.\n\u201cSee!\u201d Ed said, pointed across the field where the bottle was gone. \u201cYou did it!\u201d\nStede\u2019s mouth was catching flies, blinking rather stupidly but couldn\u2019t do anything about that.\nBehind them Lucius said, \u201cI am absolutely done for the day. Done for good actually. You can take your own notes. Won\u2019t be watching this anymore, thanks.\u201d There was a sound like a book hitting the ground.\nStede blinked a few too many times before he shook his head and smiled. \u201cI guess I did!\u201d\nEd stepped close again and squeezed his shoulder. \u201cTold you so.\u201d Stede rolled his eyes and went to retrieve the book. Pretended that he wasn\u2019t hyper aware of how close they were walking or the way his chest was aching, like it was longing for something, though he had no idea what. He certainly didn\u2019t want Ed to know any of that.\nBluffing was part of the job, right?\nread on ao3"}, {"blog_name": "your-ace-cousin-clover", "id": 683371637099397120, "date": "2022-05-05 01:26:18 GMT", "timestamp": 1651713978, "tags": ["Listen I\u2019ve had a stressful", "few days so looking at alien content made me happy", "Rhys Darby", "anyway DadOnTour is acceptable", "OFMD", "anyway go and watch it!

It is clear that Ed's fascination with him is an extension of his fascination with the aristocracy/gentry and the 'fine things' he associates with them. One of the key moments of their developing romance is built on Stede affirming Ed's place among those fine things.  I am not saying that their love was limited to that. I am sure Stede's kindness and forgiveness and his approach to both Ed and his own crew and his unassuming intelligence and loyalty in defending Ed all played a part in Ed's attraction. But so much of their early dynamic is built on Stede being Ed's window to a world he was told he did not belong and I dont think it goes away entirely. \nI think Stede breaking Ed's heart was also meant to shatter this idolized version he had built in his head. (Although there was quite a bit of self loathing involved there too) just as Stede, when he meets the Kraken is meant to shatter the version of of Ed he has where he thinks of Blackbeard as practically a seperate creature. \nThe separation was important for both of them to confront themselves. But it was also important from them to confront each other. And because we don't see Stede as hiding or divided we forget that seeing Stede without rose coloured glasses is as important to Ed as seeing the Kraken is to Stede"}, {"blog_name": "stedestits", "id": 683552146248089600, "date": "2022-05-07 01:15:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1651886125, "tags": ["yes i'm rewatching yes with rum", "i'm fascinated with what could be his only bad outfit but at least i know it gets better", "ofmd", "my posts"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z5NrBgbyTmukai00", "note_count": 3, "body": "THREE buttons undone AND an ass cutout? ep 2 was really stede's slut era"}, {"blog_name": "crispygoosehole", "id": 683164881175887872, "date": "2022-05-02 18:40:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1651516801, "tags": ["ofmd fanfic", "ofmd", "blackbonnet"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZaHK8kbx5jS1Wi00", "note_count": 3, "body": "CH. 2 when you touch me i wonder i always wonder\nwhat you could want with me\n\n          Show\n          Chapter\n        |\n        Archive of Our Own\n    \n(Alternate ending to S1.

It\u2019s a love that transcends beyond the physical. They don\u2019t need the approval of others around them, because their bond is unbreakable. It can definitely get a little messy sometimes, but it\u2019s a definite form of affection and love for each other. \nOFMD is about two queer men trying to figure out what they want to do with themselves, finding each other, and finally getting to explore themselves in a way they had never done before. By being with each other, they find that  one makes up for the other person\u2019s faults. They\u2019ve never had a chance to act upon their real feelings, and now they finally get the chance to do so, even if they struggle with it due to inexperience. It\u2019s messy, it\u2019s emotional, it\u2019s sometimes heartbreaking, but it\u2019s the most truthful they\u2019ve ever been with themselves and others around them. \nBoth of these stories are beautiful in their own ways, and are both worthy of telling.

He was also never mutinied against, actually voted in as captain by overwhelming majority. \nWould have made way more sense if it were Sam Bellamy, because of his long history with both Blackbeard and Hornigold. So their reminiscing over breakfast would be fitting, even if the love of violence wasn't. \nOn the flip side, another good choice would be Charles Vane. Vane didn't have as much of a bond with Blackbeard as Bellamy, but they did know each other. He was voted out of captaincy, so the mention of mutiny has something behind it. And Vane was well known for his violence and cruelty. So his admiration for Blackbeard's past deeds and his violent hobbies would fit the show's character. \nCalico Jack didn't fit either way and it almost seems like they picked a random pirate name out of a jar, which is inconsistent with all of the other clearly deliberate bending of facts and fun anachronisms in the show..."}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-ducks", "id": 683083324230680576, "date": "2022-05-01 21:03:42 GMT", "timestamp": 1651439022, "tags": ["isreal hands", "Izzy hands", "ofmd fic", "ofmd", "this is not what i intedned to write.", "ive been picking away at a deamon au for like a month", "but today for somereason:", "werewolfs"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Z7xA4SbwpAeCmq00", "note_count": 3, "body": "\n        all running inside - Chapter 1 - Sidespart - Our Flag Means Death (TV) [Archive of Our Own]\n    \nI bring you werewolf Izzy having a terrible time."}, {"blog_name": "ragingstillness", "id": 683272151390994432, "date": "2022-05-03 23:05:01 GMT", "timestamp": 1651619101, "tags": ["ofmd", "our flag means death", "blackbonnet", "gentlebeard", "fanfic"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZccbRnbxU6RCay00", "note_count": 23, "body": "And so I ask ye, OFMD fandom, WHERE IS MY SUGAR\ufffc\ufffc DADDY/SUGAR BABY BLACKBONNET AU????\nCome on, none of you took a look at Ed being showered in fine things and thought huh this reminds me of something? \nNone of you daydreamed about Stede draped in stolen pirate treasure?

Pirates are dirty, underhanded scoundrels and Izzy is... not. Let\u2019s take a look at e6 in particular.\nFirst, Izzy patiently waits for Blackbeard to do his thing. Seeing that he isn\u2019t, Izzy reminds Blackbeard about his promise to kill Stede (not even Izzy\u2019s idea in the first place). Once they\u2019re alone (and knowing Blackbeard\u2019s distaste for killing), Izzy offers to do it for him. Blackbeard declines, insisting he\u2019ll do it himself, and so Izzy tries his hardest to help with that, \neven when doing so requires him to play nice with Stede.\nWhen Izzy realizes that Blackbeard isn\u2019t going to follow through, he decides to do it himself... by challenging Stede to a duel. He didn\u2019t *have* to do that; if Izzy simply wanted to murder Stede, it would have been easy to find a \u201csneakier\u201d opportunity. Blackbeard himself had planned to assassinate Stede when they were alone, so there\u2019s no reason to think he\u2019d disapprove of the method. Izzy even offers Stede a (perfectly serviceable, seemingly unsabotaged) sword, since Stede doesn\u2019t have his own.\u00a0Basically, he picks the least underhanded approach possible of trying to kill Stede.\nOf course, that\u2019s if you believe he was trying to kill Stede at all, which I honestly don\u2019t. Izzy starts off by a \u201cwarning\u201d sword to the throat. Then he knocks Stede down to the ground and puts a sword to him again, saying\u00a0\u201cyield or die\u201d (to which Stede stalls an answer for before getting out pocket sand). Then he disarms Stede and puts a sword to his throat for a \nthird \ntime, once again offering Stede the opportunity to surrender. Only after Stede clearly refuses via \u201cLet\u2019s call it a draw\u201d does Izzy actually stab him.\u00a0\nAnd then, when Izzy\u2019s sword breaks, Buttons walks up and declares Stede won... because Izzy\u2019s weapon is rendered inoperable. Nevermind that Izzy \nalready\n disarmed Stede of his sword beforehand. Nevermind that Izzy could literally pick up Stede\u2019s sword if he wanted. The crew just starts shouting about Stede winning while saying \u201cIn your face, Jizzy.\u201d Izzy looks at Blackbeard to be the voice of reason, wearing the most forlorn expression... and Blackbeard just shrugs. (It was funny the first time but soooo tragic on the rewatch.)\nAs he packs up to leave, Izzy pleads to Blackbeard,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re really allowing this?\u201d Because Izzy tried so hard to play by the rules, something no one else seemed to care about. But ultimately Blackbeard\u2019s rule is most important to him, so he accepts the exile without even arguing.\u00a0\nThe fact that Izzy is so clearly trying to do things \u201cproperly\u201d even while absolutely furious makes this all the more poignant. And this is just e6; we see this aspect of Izzy\u2019s personality all throughout the show, such as his comment in e3 that Stede was\u00a0\u201cunprofessional\u201d for tricking and ambushing him in e2. So that makes it all the more impressive that this personality trait was interwoven so subtly (in my opinion).\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also a sharp contrast with Stede\u2019s own knack for fuckery and dirty tricks, which matches up better with Ed\u2019s personality and honestly seems a lot more classically piratey."}, {"blog_name": "our-flag-means-death-ao3feed", "id": 683067170268364800, "date": "2022-05-01 16:46:56 GMT", "timestamp": 1651423616, "tags": ["Our flag means death", "ofmd"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZECR5SbwlVZfay00", "note_count": 1, "body": "3 times izzy walked in on ed &amp; stede (+ 1 time ed walked in on izzy)\nby \nanthonyjcrowiey\nWhat it says on the tin.\n\n\nThis fic is complete and will be updated regularly!\nWords: 1121, Chapters: 1/4, Language: English\nFandoms: \nOur Flag Means Death (TV)\nRating: \nExplicit\nWarnings: \nNo Archive Warnings Apply\nCategories: \nM/M\nCharacters: \nIsrael Hands\n, \nLucius Spriggs\n, \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach\n, \nStede Bonnet\n, \nButtons (Our Flag Means Death)\n, \nFang (Our Flag Means Death)\nRelationships: \nBlackbeard | Edward Teach/Stede Bonnet\n, \nIsrael Hands/Lucius Spriggs\nAdditional Tags: \nPining\n, \nWalking In On Someone\n, \nCoitus Interruptus\n, \nAnal Sex\n, \nBlow Jobs\n, \nSemi-Public Sex\n, \nEmotionally Repressed\n, \nSexual Repression\n, \nExplicit Sexual Content\n, \nLucius Spriggs Deserves a Raise\n, \nTherapist Lucius Spriggs\n, \nLucius 'you want to fuck me so bad it makes you look stupid' Spriggs\n, \nEveryone Is Gay\n, \nUnder-negotiated Kink\n\nsource \nhttps://archiveofourown.org/works/38722998"}, {"blog_name": "salt-hag", "id": 683721223118716928, "date": "2022-05-08 22:02:50 GMT", "timestamp": 1652047370, "tags": ["if tumblr loves 2 things you gotta have a mashup", "idk if stede or ed work better as dracula but that\u2019s not my job I\u2019m not the fic writer here", "ofmd", "dracula daily"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/Ziuy6wbz4DHrOm00", "note_count": 7, "body": "Ok but ofmd stede bonnet/edward teach dracula au where one of them is the hapless lawyer and the other is the vampire who does all the chores when the other\u2019s back is turned"}, {"blog_name": "catboycecil", "id": 683104242428510208, "date": "2022-05-02 02:36:11 GMT", "timestamp": 1651458971, "tags": ["ofmd", "spoilers: yes"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZLblpZbwtx1oWu00", "note_count": 3, "body": "Am I going to watch ofmd for the third time this week??

He's confident in his skills, in his intelligence, in his body, in his charisma. \nWhat I found interesting, is that he's also confident in being himself. And it's interesting to me, because he spends so much time masking parts of himself. With this kind of character, I would expect some insecurity about showing parts of himself he usually keeps hidden, maybe even shame.\nEd is performing toxic masculinity with perfect ease. But, from the moment he meets Stede, Ed doesn't shy from showing his softer side. Not only with Stede, but with everyone else. He lets himself be silly (with the clothes sharing), he lets everyone see that he wants to learn about fine things, he's vocal about enjoying soap, he tells the crew he got scared by their fuckery! When he comes back after the break up he lays himself bare, and even after reverting to 'the kraken', he flies a flag \nwith a bleeding heart.\n He's basically telling the whole world that he got his heart broken.\nSo it seems Ed wasn't performing toxic masculinity because he was ashamed of his softer side. I believe it was just that this was the norm around him, and also a useful tool to get the respect of others. But the moment those things became less relevant he just stopped. He didn't need to learn how not to be ashamed of being soft and caring, and this is so refreshing.\nThe one thing Ed is constantly shown to be insecure about, is his social status when compared to 'civilized' society, and by extension whether he's good enough for Stede. Civilization is the only place where he doesn't feel at home, and the show goes a long way to show us that rather than learning to be confident within civilized society, the right thing for him to do is to stay himself. \n(As an amusing aside, the only time I can remember we see him truly embarrassed, is on the treasure hunt. And he does it with the grace of a 14 y.o who doesn't want their friends to see them doing some stupid activity with their parents.)"}, {"blog_name": "spooky-lemon-bitch", "id": 683692948923318272, "date": "2022-05-08 14:33:25 GMT", "timestamp": 1652020405, "tags": ["our flag means death", "ofmd", "izzy hands", "edward teach", "stede bonnet", "ofmd modern au", "frenchie x izzy", "ethan yells"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZUFwjabyznrS0u00", "note_count": 14, "body": "I've been thinking of writing an Our Flag Means Death modern au and I really need to get the details out because I am excited!! about!! it!!\nI also have an outline for the fic in mind but I dont want to spoil it if I do write it, so here's some of the details for the fic I may or may not write :)))\n-freshly divorced stede moves to an apartment by the sea and buys an old bar that he turns into a gay club\n-stede and mary are besties!! they divorced cause stede's dad finally died so they could separate without any drama or stress.\n-mary tells stede all about her new painting instructor doug and stede encourages her to ask him out, she does the same for him with ed. they are just very supportive of each other!! \n(the kids are also there but I'm not sure they'll play a big part, but they are there!!)\n-stede hires some of the crew to work at the gay bar which he has called 'the revenge'\n-jim works as security, frenchie and the swede are entertainment, buttons, wee john and lucius work the bar, lucius also helps with running the place and art/design (other jobs are filled by randos)\n-'the revenge' is across the street from the very popular 'blackbeards bar and grill' and down the street from 'spanish jackies animal shelter'\n-ed owns 'blackbeards bar and grill' and is one of the cooks, roach is also a cook, fang and ivan work the bar and izzy is the manager (other jobs are also filled by randos)\n-and not too far down the street at 'spanish jackies animal shelter', jackie owns the place, pete and oluwande are members of staff, fang, jim and buttons volunteer occasionally (other jobs are filled by jackies husbands)\n-some small details; \n>buttons has two rescue seagulls karl and olivia that can't be released into the wild. \n>jim and oluwande are already dating. \n>lucius hasnt met fang or pete yet.\n>pete and fang are in a friends with benefits type relationship (for now ;)).\n>both ed and stede will eventually adopt a cat each\n>ed names his 'queenie' (the real blackbeard's ship was called the queen annes revenge, which was originally stede's ship the revenge)\n>stede names his 'the kraken' (self explanitory)\n>ed has a motorbike\n>lucius does art commissions online as well (mostly porn)\n>i dont know how yet (nor do i really care) but izzy and frenchie will end up together by the end (though they wont be the focus)\n>ed and izzy are dating but its a mutually toxic relationship, they are not good for each other!!\n>ed will break it off because stede makes him realize just how bad they are for each other.

And like, okay, look, yes\u2014Blackbeard signs the Act of Grace with an X. But that really doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't know how to read, and it doesn't make a ton of sense that he wouldn't, even without the historical context in which he \nabsolutely\n knew how to read. \nLike, there's at least one book sitting in his cabin the first time we see him. His reaction when Stede shows him the library, and the page with a picture of him, suggests that he can do some basic reading, at least enough to recognize his moniker and appreciate the amount of work it would take to read that many books. He'd at the very least need to be able to do some decent mathematics for the budgeting needed to run a pirate ship, lay in supplies, divvy up plunder, etc. Even the improvised banter when they\u2019re signing the Act of Grace implies he can read. \nHe could have done an X on the Act of Grace figuring that it would be harder to hold him to it if his actual name isn't on it, or because he was embarrassed for his crappy handwriting/spelling to be compared to Stede's, or simply because he's been signing himself that way for a while. But it's unlikely that he can't read. \nActual literacy rates among English men in the 18th century were between 30-60% depending on which source you're checking. Granted, you'd expect it to be lower on a ship of bottom-of-the-barrel pirates, but Stede and Lucius being the only literate members of the crew is actually fairly unlikely. And given that we see a good chunk of the crew playing cards in the opening scene\u2014which means at the very least they can recognize numbers 1-10 and some letters, and Roach can at least read recipes, unless Stede sat there and repeated the orange cake recipe until he had it memorized, etc. It seems fairly likely that what Lucius means is he's the only one other than Stede who can read \nwell enough\n to enjoy long books, not that the entire crew is completely illiterate.

Adventure awaits! My map tells of an ancient lost treasure in these parts!\u201d\nEdward watched with a raised eyebrow and a slight smile curling at his lip. The rest of the crew looked warily at him for guidance, but he shrugged easily and followed after Stede with a light step, always interested to see where the other captain\u2019s whims would take them.\nAs expected, the lot of pirates who\u2019d been bored and desperate enough to follow him trounced around the forest all day and halfway into the sunset without so much as locating a single landmark on Stede\u2019s fake treasure map, not that the man cared or even particularly noticed. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close now! I can sense it! Something fantastical lies just beyond this cliff, and we\u2019ll all have enough treasure to sink a ship with it!\u201d\nHe was wrong of course, but less wrong than usual. There was no treasure by standard means, but Ed was satisfied that they\u2019d found something more fun that some old loot was anyway.\n\u201cWell well, what do we have here,\u201d Ed said with interest, as everyone else passed by the pond with barely a glance. Whether they hadn\u2019t noticed the roils of steam heating the air or just hadn\u2019t cared Ed didn\u2019t know, but he held up a hand and the entire procession of pirates instantly stopped to see what had caught his attention. \u201cI think we\u2019ve found our treasure.\u201d\nEveryone glanced at him, mild confusion coloring the party. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize it?\u201d Ed said with an easy smile, leaning down to test the water temperature with his fingers. \u201cThis here\u2019s the Fountain of Youth, boys.\u201d\nStede looked from the hot spring down to his map, then back to the hot spring again. \u201cWell of course!\u201d He agreed with enthusiastic cheer, pointing at the paper. \u201cYou can see it right here! X marks the spot!\u201d\nSatisfied, he folded the map up and put it into his pocket, a job well done. \u201cWell then. It\u2019s late enough that we probably won\u2019t make it back to the ship tonight. Why don\u2019t we ah, camp out here and enjoy the splendors of our bounty?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat, you mean like,\u201d Lucius\u2019s face pinched. \u201cTake a bath? Right there in the open forest, naked and with all the rest of you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Fountain of Youth, mate,\u201d Ed said seriously. \u201cThe only way for it to work is to try it, now isn't it?\u201d\n\u201cCome on now, Lucius! We can take turns. You can go with Black Pete, I\u2019ll take a dip with Ed, and uh, that leaves Jim and The Swede as a set!\u201d\n\u201cPass,\u201d Jim said, instantly and without hesitation.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy, are you afraid of all of us seeing what you\u2019ve got?\u201d Black Pete said, no small amount of depreciation in his tone.\u00a0\nJim let their gaze travel over the gathered men. \u201cCan\u2019t say that one worries me at the moment. Just don\u2019t feel like being anything close to naked anywhere near any one of you.\u201d They nodded towards The Swede, eyes narrowed in distrust. \u201cEspecially that one. At least the rest of you are open books.\u201d\n\u201cWe could trade if you like! Would you feel more comfortable if your partner was Lucuis?\u201d Stede offered.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just gonna pass all together, thanks.\u201d\nEd nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fair. Sun\u2019s going down, so we\u2019ll likely be here all night if you change your mind and decide to take a solo dip later on.\u201d\nJim nodded, looking slightly tempted by the idea. Ed didn\u2019t blame them. That hot water was a siren song after spending all day and Lord knows how long before that covered in sweat and sea salt.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat, excellent, glad that's settled,\u201d Lucius said tightly. \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn first, so everyone can go make camp while I take the bath I so desperately need and deserve.\u201d\n\u201cRight behind you, babe.\u201d Black Pete said, taking off his shirt without a hint of hesitation.\nStede looked a bit disappointed. \u201cAs Captain, I had really hoped to try it out first. For your sakes of course. What if the spring is dangerous and you regress in age into little babies?\u201d\nEd put a hand on his shoulder to gently steer him away. \u201cYeah mate, he\u2019s taking his pants off. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d care even if they were listening.\u201d\n\u201cNothing untoward in the Fountain of Youth, now! Please leave it sanitary for the rest of us!\u201d\n\u201cYes, Captain,\u201d Lucius and Black Pete chorused, and Ed gave Stede a bit of a push to lead him away from the hot spring.\nBy the time the camp was set up and the others had all taken their turns, it was well into night. The trees had cleared near the hot spring and the moon was shining down, bright and peaceful as Ed and Stede quietly undressed next to the spring, everyone else sitting around the fire at the camp stationed a few meters away and just out of sight.\nThe pair of them needed no words as they slipped into the heated water, settling down near one another in comfortable silence, Black Pete\u2019s voice ringing dim in the distance as he told another story he\u2019d never been there for to people who were barely listening or cared.\n\u201cNow this is pretty nice,\u201d Ed commented idly as he settled down into the spring, dipping briefly under the water so his entire head would be wet and not just the bottom of his beard. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a hot bath under the stars before. Cold ones in the ocean, maybe, but never a nice hot one.\u201d\nNext to him, Stede hummed in agreement, tipping his head back to look at the sky. \u201cThe breeze feels wonderful. Cool air and hot water always make for a lovely combination. But the stars\u2026 Really do add their own touch to the magic, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cWell it is magic, isn\u2019t it? This here is the Fountain of Youth.\u201d Ed said, though wasn\u2019t looking at the sky. He was still looking at Stede, lit by the moon and the faint light of the fire flickering in the distance. The most ridiculous man Ed had ever met, and already more fun than Ed had ever had in years of the so-called freedom that came with being a pirate. Ed could get used to spending time like this, chasing after magic and finding it hiding in the little things all along the way.\nStede was his own unique brand of dangerous. He wasn\u2019t deadly, but the way he could move a man just with his relentless optimistic cheer could make the devil jealous of his charm. Ed had been intrigued from the start, and the more he learned about Stede Bonnet the more found himself wanting to know, and the more time they spent together the more Ed craved his company. No matter what he got from Stede he always wanted more, but it didn\u2019t feel like a curse. It felt like a breath of fresh air. Ed hadn\u2019t found himself wanting so much for himself in a long time.\nEven now, he wanted more than he was allowed. Always had been one of his faults - greed of a pirate, always driving Ed to want more than what was good for him.\u00a0\nExcept maybe, just this one time, what he wanted wasn't bad for him after all. Maybe it could even be good for him.\n\"I do have to thank you, Ed,\" Steve said eventually, breaking the calm quiet with his words. \u201cBefore you came along, the men were\u2026 a bit reluctant to follow me, and probably for good reason. Even today, if you hadn\u2019t noticed this hot spring I can imagine the crew would have gotten a bit irritable with me for dragging them out all day like this.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one that led us here. All I did was wanna take a dip, you did the rest.\u201d Ed dismissed easily. \u201cThe crew likes you. You don\u2019t need to worry so much.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but liking me isn\u2019t the same as trusting me,\u201d Stede said softly. \u201cOr respecting me.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ed said reasonably, \u201cI\u2019ve never been terribly well-liked as a captain, to be honest.

Good job, Stede!\nDownside, though: This means that he talks about stuff he used to do with Mary (hair brushing?), and how he's doing it now with Ed (HAIR BRUSHING), and Ed gets \nreal fucking squirrelly\n about it and runs away for a bit to have Feelings.\nWhere he goes to have Feelings is, it turns out, Mary\u2019s front parlor (thereby accomplishing important Scariness and also maybe figuring out what made her so special that Stede keeps bringing her up all the fucking time).\nWhat this really turns into, though, is a lovely excuse for THE \u201cED AND MARY BONDING OVER STEDE\u2019S BULLSHIT VARIETY HOUR\u201d THAT WE ALL DESERVE.\u00a0\nStede will \nrun,\n windblown, into the house, having used his magical gaydar to figure out where Ed went and hoping he\u2019s gotten here in time to take away knives. (Whose knives? All the knives.) But\u00a0what\u2019s revealed upon his arrival is that Mary has, of course, already taken all of Ed\u2019s knives. She is using them to cut oranges for them both.\nDoug, who had gotten over his initial uncertainty about all this some hours ago, is happily making lunch for everyone -- Stede is promptly sent to join him, and lasts for all of approximately .5 seconds before he jitters off to go bother the children-- which turns out to be a \ngreat\n idea, actually, because apparently the kids are planning an elaborate high-stakes \nraid\n of the parlor where Mum and \nthe most fearsome pirate ever\n are having a parley.\u00a0\n(Alma is in charge, though. Her brother is made first mate because, and this is very important, Father has to be the absolute lowest rank on the ship.)\n(Does he clean privies? There are no privies on ships? Gross. Then he\u2019s in charge of whatever the most worst thing is besides that while Captain Alma and her trusty sidekick plan the most daring attack ever attempted, because\u00a0if there\u2019s one thing that everybody now plotting in the nursery can agree on, it\u2019s that elaborate piracy scenarios are always the \nbest\n way to spend an afternoon.)\nAt any rate: Eventually, Doug drops off lunch. He also drops off the Threatening Warning Alma handed him while loudly saying that it is Deadly Secret and Cannot Fall Into the Hands of the Enemy. It\u2019s probably a pen knife that\u2019s had 1700s-crayon rubbed on it to look like blood.\nMary sighs.\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be invaded.\u201d\nEd takes the knife and says, wonderingly,\u00a0\u201cAre you fucking kidding me. Amazing.\u201d And Mary watches as he starts to clean the knife -- with her good linens, are you fucking kidding indeed -- but he\u2019s still smiling and getting excited and it\u2019s like Stede at his best when he was home.

Throughout the show Ed\u2019s wardrobe has signified what level of intimidation he is trying to project and to a degree, if he is portraying \u201cBlackbeard\u201d at any given moment.\u00a0\nSo, Ed killed Lucius.\u00a0\nHe could have chosen any member of the crew to kill besides Lucius. Oluwande would have made sense, since Oluwande had a lot of Stede\u2019s trust and was one of the people that Stede brought aboard for the dinner party. Pete would have made sense, since he was always following Blackbeard around and trying to get in his good graces. But he chose Lucius...why?\nBecause Lucius is the only one who tried to directly intervene in his and Stede\u2019s relationship, besides Izzy Hands. But Lucius encouraged it. Lucius gave advice. Lucius has experience with queer relationships. Lucius is not ashamed of who he is, he\u2019s very open about it. He\u2019s unabashedly effeminate, sensitive, soft. He\u2019s a portrayal of the type of man part of Ed yearns to be, a man like Stede. But Ed feels that is impossible for him. He thinks he was rejected by Stede. This is a direct parallel to what happened at the dinner party with the upper crust. Lucius and Stede represent a world that Ed feels he cannot be part of, not only because they are educated, white, and openly queer/effeminate, but because he sees them as good men and he sees himself as a monster. A Kraken. The Kraken is a representation of his resistance, his rebellion against a world that does not want people like him to exist. It\u2019s a rebellion using the tools of toxic masculinity and violence- the only tools that have ever gotten people to respect him. Lucius was the only one to comfort him at his lowest point. Izzy Hands criticized him. Killing Lucius symbolizes Ed\u2019s rejection of his own yearnings, and his attempt to hide any evidence of vulnerability from the world, such that it can no longer hurt him. He is violently cutting off avenues of support that would make him a better, more vulnerable man. Because then, he would have to confront his pain. He did all of this in the transition between being Ed and Blackbeard, which makes it even worse. Because it was always Blackbeard or the Kraken who did those horrible things. Never Ed. But he\u2019s still wearing the dressing gown, his beard is still shaved, his hair is still groomed, when he kills Lucius. The only thing which has changed is his smile, devoid of happiness. More of a grimace than anything. Ed was supposed to be Blackbeard\u2019s better half, his true self. This is the equivalent of seeing an angel fall from heaven, so much more painful than if they had never had a chance to be better in the first place.\u00a0 Killing Lucius is what makes Ed become the Kraken again. It\u2019s not a result of it. It\u2019s the cause. The next time he cries is alone. Where no one can see. The tears ruining his Kraken makeup.

Making out for the better part of two weeks (much to the frustrations of the crew I'd imagine who are like. Yes hi we're raiding your ship yes also our cocaptains are making out in between sword fights with your crew like their lives depend on it. The faster you surrender the faster we get you away from the PDA.) Or spending like. A month being obsessed with just blowjobs or handjobs (and I absolutely see Stede as the kinky fuck who loves to try and sneak them in public or in locations where it's a challenge, which is a delightful surprise for Ed.) \nAnd when they do get to more, still taking it slow with plenty of check-ins because it isn't just wanting to make sure everything is comfortable and feeling good, it's wanting to learn each other that way. There's the joy of the initial lesson but then the repeated love of knowing exactly how to make another person fall apart happily in that way\nOnce they do finally fuck I have a feeling it's just. Like Christmas. And even after the initial gleam wears away to it being another slice of the pie in their lives, they're still touchy feely little shits with each other.
